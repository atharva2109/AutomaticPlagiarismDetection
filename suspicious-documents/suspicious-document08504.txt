For combined beauty and interest--varied beauty and historical interest--there is no place
"within easy reach of London", certainly no place within the suburban radius, that can compare
with the stately Tudor palace which stands on the left bank of the Thames, little more than
a dozen miles from the metropolis and, though hidden in trees, within eye-reach of Richmond.
It is not only one of the "show places", which every traveller from afar is supposed to visit
as something of a duty, but it is a place that conveys impressions of beauty and restfulness
in a way that few others can. It remains ancient without having lapsed into a state of desuetude
that leaves everything to the imagination; it is a living whole far from any of the garishness
that belongs to contemporaneity. Whether seen from the outside on the west, where the warm
red brick, the varied roofs, the clustered decorative chimneys suggestive of the Tudor time
make a rich and harmonious whole; or from the south east, where the many-windowed long straight
lines of the Orange additions show the red brick diversified with white stone, it is a noble
and impressive pile. Within, too, are priceless treasures, themselves alone the objective of
countless pilgrimages. And recognizing the attractions of the buildings and their contents
is to take no account of the lovely grounds, and of the crowding associations of a place that,
since its establishment four hundred years ago, has again and again been the centre at which
history was made.

Throughout our records for many centuries the valley of the Thames has been favoured when our
monarchs have sought to establish a new home. Greenwich and London--the Tower, Whitehall, Buckingham
Palace--Richmond and Hampton Court, Windsor, Reading and Oxford, are some of the places that
have at one time or another been the chosen centre of royal life; and Hampton Court Palace
is the newest of those situated close on the river's bank, though nearly two hundred years
have elapsed since it was a regular royal residence. It was, indeed, for something less than
the same length of time that it was in use as a home of the sovereign, but within that period
it saw two revolutions, and the change of national conditions from the comparative mediævalism
of the days of the eighth Henry to the comparative modernity of the beginning of the Hanoverian
era. It is not, perhaps, overfanciful to see something of the lavish richness, the opulent
homeliness, of the earlier period typified in the varied buildings, courts, and gateways of
the Tudor portion of the Palace, and the more formal grandeur of the later time in the symmetrical
stateliness of the later part.

Hampton Court Palace was the centre of many of the bluff King Henry's hunting parties--and
the scene of some of his marital excitements, and here, too, his long-hoped-for son was born;
it was the scene of Elizabethan pageantry, and of the attempt on the part of the Virgin Queen's
successor to force other men's religion into his own particular groove; at Hampton Court Charles
the First was seen at his best in the domestic circle and--after the interregnum--where his
son was seen at his worst in anti-domestic intrigues. Here Cromwell sought rest from cares
greater than those of a king, and here he was stricken with mortal illness; here William and
Mary dwelt, and here the former met with the seemingly trivial accident which cost him his
life. That the "story" of Hampton Court is, indeed, a full, splendid, and varied one is shown
in the three fine volumes in which it is set forth by Mr. Ernest Law, a work to which no writer
on the history of the Palace can help feeling indebted. Those who would learn the intimacies
and details of the history of the place have Mr. Law's history, and those who seek a "guide"
are well provided for in the official publications. Here, I am concerned with the history of
the place only in its broader and more salient points, and with the minor details necessary
in a guidebook not at all; I seek rather to give something of an impression of the past and
present of the Palace, something that shall at once indicate the associations of the place,
indicate its story, and hint at what there is to see, and that shall serve as souvenir and
remembrancer of that which has been seen.

It was just before he became a cardinal that Thomas Wolsey, on 11 January, 1515, took a ninety-nine
years' lease of the manor of Hampton Court from the Knights Hospitaller of St. John of Jerusalem,
and at once set about building the magnificent pile which remains his most enduring monument.
There appears to have been here an earlier manor house or mansion, for there is a record of
Henry the Seventh visiting it a few years before the lease was granted; but probably Wolsey
did away entirely with the older building and planned the whole place anew. Rapidly rising
in royal favour the Cardinal designed a lordly pleasure house on the banks of the Thames, where
he could worthily entertain his pleasure-loving sovereign, and where he could hold state in
a manner that should prove impressive in the eyes of ambassadors and other important visitors
from foreign Courts.

It is said that Wolsey's health was such that it was necessary for him to have a residence
away from London, yet his position made it essential that he should still be within easy reach
of the capital; therefore he "employed the most eminent physicians in England and even called
in the aid of doctors from Padua, to select the most healthy spot within twenty miles of London",
and the result was the selection of Hampton and the erection of the princely Palace which has
seen its royal neighbours of Hanworth and Richmond pass from palaces to mere fragments, and
Nonsuch disappear entirely.

Having acquired his new manor Wolsey lost no time in getting his designs carried into execution,
and the magnificent edifice, built about five courts or quadrangles, grew so rapidly that in
1516 he was already able to entertain Henry the Eighth here. The whole Palace was of red brick,
and surmounted by many castellated turrets topped by ornamental lead cupolas. The western portion
of the buildings probably gives us a very fair idea of the whole as it was planned, though
all the turrets from this aspect are wanting their cupolas, though the gatehouse is less lofty
than it was originally and though some more westerly buildings have disappeared.

As the Cardinal waxed in importance his stately palace grew until its magnificence set tongues
wagging, and it was said that the Churchman's residence outshone in splendour the castles of
the King. John Skelton, in his satire Why come ye not to Court? probably only gave fuller expression
to things which many people were saying, when the powerful favourite was approaching the period
of his declination:

    "Why come ye not to court?
    To whyche Court?
    To Kynge's courte,
    Or to Hampton Court?--
    Nay, to the Kynge's court:
    The Kynge's Courte
    Shulde have the excellence;
    But Hampton Court
    Hath the preemynence.
    And Yorke's Place
    With my lord's grace,
    To whose magnifycence
    Is all the conflewence,
    Sutys and supplycacons
    Embassades of all nacyons."

York Place was Cardinal Wolsey's scarcely less magnificent residence at Westminster.

Whether inspired by jealousy owing to the things said of the state upheld by Wolsey, or whether
his repeated visits simply inspired the monarch with envy of his Chancellor's new palace cannot
be said, but when Hampton Court had been building for ten years King Henry, we are told, asked
the Chancellor why he had erected so magnificent a place. "To show how noble a palace a subject
may offer to his Sovereign," was the reply of the Cardinal--a truly courtly and an unquestionably
costly compliment. The King accepted the noble gift, but Wolsey continued from time to time
to occupy his own whilom palace at Hampton and was besides given permission to make use of
the royal palace at Richmond. This was in 1525, and already it may be the shadow of coming
events was over both the powerful Churchman and the fickle King, though Wolsey was still three
or four years from that final downfall which was soon followed by his death.

Though the ownership of Hampton Court had passed from the subject to the sovereign, the former
continued on occasion to do the honours of the place to distinguished visitors. In 1527, for
example, there came a noble "ambasset" from France, and arrangements were made for the due
entertainment here of the French nobles and their retinue. A full account of it is given in
George Cavendish's Life and Death of Thomas Wolsey, the earliest of our biographies and assuredly
one of the most delightful. There is not space here to transcribe Cavendish's full account
of the splendid entertainment accorded to "this great ambasset ... who were in number above
fourscore and the most noblest and worthiest gentlemen in all the court of France"; but the
biographer, who was gentleman-usher to the Cardinal, and thus well situated for giving an authoritative
record of things, was also an admirable narrator, and from his description we may get a good
idea of Tudor prodigality and splendour. Not only were there the fourscore French nobles, but
there were also their trains and the many home visitors who must have been invited to accompany
them; so that two hundred and eighty beds had to be arranged. We are told how the best cooks
were brought together, and wrought day and night in the preparing of "divers subtleties and
many crafty devices", how the purveyors "brought and sent in such plenty of costly provisions
as ye would wonder at the same", and further:

    "The yeomen and grooms of the wardrobes were busied in
    hanging of the chambers with costly hangings, and
    furnishing the same with beds of silk, and other
    furniture apt for the same in every degree. Then my Lord
    Cardinal sent me, being gentleman usher, with two other
    of my fellows, to Hampton Court to foresee all things
    touching our rooms, to be noblily garnished accordingly.
    Our pains were not small or light, but travailing daily
    from chamber to chamber. Then the carpenters, the
    joiners, the masons, the painters, and all other
    artificers necessary to glorify the house and feast were
    set to work. There was carriage and re-carriage of
    plate, stuff and other rich implements; so that there
    was nothing lacking or to be imagined or devised for the
    purpose. There were also fourteen score beds provided
    and furnished with all manner of furniture to them
    belonging, too long particularly here to rehearse. But
    to all wise men it sufficeth to imagine, that knoweth
    what belongeth to the furniture of such triumphant feast
    or banquet."

Cavendish goes on to tell of the sumptuousness and wonder of the entertainment which the Cardinal
gave to his guests before speeding them on their way to Windsor on the following day. Of the
furnishing of the chambers for the "fourteen score beds" prepared for the guests, he gives
details which suggest an extraordinary display of gold and silver; but the whole account should
be read in the biography of Wolsey, where it gives us a peculiarly full and detailed description
of the splendour of banqueting in Tudor days. And it must be added, that though "the Frenchmen,
as it seemed, were rapt into paradise", yet this feast at Hampton Court was but as "silver
is compared to gold" when contrasted with that which the King gave at Greenwich a little later
to speed his parting guests on their homeward journey. In the full account which Cavendish
gives of the feasting at Hampton Court and in his description of the furnishings of York House,
Westminster, when Wolsey left it on his last unhappy journey, we have glimpses of the richness
and magnificence to which the great men of the sixteenth century had attained in the heyday
of Henry the Eighth. King Henry was at Hampton Court, engaged in practising archery in the
park when George Cavendish arrived with the news of Wolsey's death, and the bluff King paid
his old and too loyal servant the tribute of saying that he would rather have given £20,000
than he had died. The King did not, however, let any sentiment about the builder of Hampton
Court trouble him long or interfere with his plans.

When the monarch came into full possession of Hampton Court he soon converted the lease into
freehold by arrangements with the Knights Hospitaller, and at once set about having it made
yet more magnificent than before. Among his improvements was the erection of the Great Hall--one
of the finest buildings of the kind belonging to the Tudor period that remain to us; he rebuilt,
or at any rate considerably altered, the Chapel, and made many other changes in the Palace.
His additions and alterations may sometimes be recognized by the working of his monogram and
those of his wives into the decoration, as in the roof of Anne Boleyn's Gateway, where that
unhappy lady's initial is to be seen. For though this roof is a modern restoration, it is a
restoration believed to be in accordance with the original design. Such evidence is not therefore
always conclusive, for sometimes the monograms are not contemporary records--as in the windows
of the Great Hall where the stained glass, full of such personal allusions, is all modern,
having been put in between sixty and seventy years ago. Those responsible for the replacing,
after a long interval, of the glass that had been destroyed when all concerning royalty was
out of favour, worked in monograms and devices in a way that misleads many visitors, some of
whom seeing "H" and "J" in the glass, too rashly assume that it dates from the time when Jane
Seymour was the much married monarch's queen.

When Anne Boleyn's ambition was gratified and she was made Henry's second queen--vice Katherine
of Arragon, divorced--Hampton Court became for a time a scene of royal revelling. It was not
so for long, however, for already the King's passion was cooling. It was at Hampton Court that
King Henry's hopes of a son and heir were disappointed for the third time, when, early in 1536,
Anne there gave birth to a still-born child. In the following May the unhappy Queen's brief
triumph was brought to a tragic close by the sword of the executioner on Tower Hill, and on
the very next day King Henry was formally betrothed to Jane Seymour. In October of the following
year Queen Jane gave birth in this Palace, presumably in that part of the buildings demolished
more than a century and a half later, to a son who afterwards became King Edward the Sixth.
The arrival of a male heir was no doubt a matter of great gratification to King Henry, and
served to lessen any sorrow that his easily salved affections might otherwise have felt from
the fact that the Queen only survived the child's birth but a brief while. When he was but
three days old the infant prince was christened here in great state. The Princess Mary held
her tiny brother, twenty years her junior, during the ceremony at the solid silver font, while
the child Princess Elizabeth, herself carried, bore the chrysm. Nine days after the christening
of her son Queen Jane died.

The birth of Prince Edward in the Palace seems to have increased King Henry's liking for his
Thames-side pleasaunce, and in 1540 he caused the Honour of Hampton Court to be created by
Act of Parliament--the Honour including a number of manors on both sides of the Thames. But
the King further showed his liking for the place--and his scant regard for his subjects--by
making it the centre of a Chase, having a large extent of the land on either side of the river
afforested and enclosed with palings so that, though growing corpulent and unwieldy, he might
yet be able to indulge in his favourite pastime of hunting.

At the end of July, 1540, King Henry quietly married Katherine Howard, and in August she was
openly shown at Hampton Court as his fifth queen. ARTHUR SWEETSER, GORDON LAMONT.

 It is, however, necessary to know the place closely
to appreciate it fully--it grows upon one, as the saying is; we should have seen the homely
court of the Master Carpenter as well as the stately Fountain Court, the sculptures in the
gardens as well as the encyclopædic clock, the kitchens as well as the picture galleries, to
have lingered about the Wilderness in the spring as well as to have seen the Broad Walk in
the blaze of summer, to have visited in some of the residences as well as to have passed through
the public galleries, to have been about it at all seasons and not merely to have scampered
through it as the central incident in a half-day's excursion. It is, indeed, properly a place
for restful enjoyment rather than for hurried sightseeing; though a hurried glimpse may well
prove a provocation to further visits and more leisurely inspection.

Perhaps in beginning a ramble about the Palace and its grounds it may be assumed that most
people arrive by railway at the station which, though it is in East Molesey at the Surrey end
of the bridge, takes its name from the palace on the Middlesex bank. This means that they enter
it--as also do those who journey from London by tramcar--at the Trophy Gate, and have before
them at once, at the end of a broad gravel walk, the Outer Court and the rich red-brick medley
of the Tudor buildings, to which the eye is led by the severely plain row of low barracks on
the left, and a row of fine elms along the towing path on the right. Here, at the west front,
the recently-cleared moat at once attracts attention. Until within the past year or two the
gravel forecourt extended right up to the palace walls, but excavation revealed that the course
of the moat, and the very walls of the moat, and the old bridge approach to the Gatehouse were
still plainly traceable. The rubbish with which long since the moat had been filled--possibly
when William the Third made his alterations to the Palace, or perhaps even earlier--was cleared
away, the brick sides revealed, the bottom of the moat neatly turfed over, and a parapet with
shield-bearing heraldical beasts erected on either side. These heraldical beasts, it must be
admitted--whether a restoration in accordance with an old design or not--tend to spoil the
approach to the Great Gatehouse, for the whole would have gained in dignity had they been omitted
and the plain low castellated wall remained unadorned. The similar banner-bearing heraldical
beasts along the roof of the Great Hall look far better on the skyline--but their fellows on
the eyeline below mar the dignity of the approach considerably.

The beautiful red brickwork, the various castellated turrets, and the clusters of decorated
chimneys, with the quaintly carven beasts seemingly toboganning down the gables of the wings,
together form a fine example of Tudor architecture, though the appearance would have been still
better had the Gatehouse when restored in the eighteenth century been kept to its original
proportions, and had the leaden cupolas not been removed from the many turrets. Two or three
of those turrets that remain in other parts of the buildings retain their cupolas, to indicate
how fine must have been the whole effect before any had been removed. In the wall of either
tower of the gateway is to be seen a terra-cotta medallion portrait of one of the Cæsars, others
of which will be noticed in the succeeding courts.

The wing to the right as we front the Gatehouse is the south-west wing and is worthy of special
mention before entering the buildings, for there one of Hampton Court's ghosts has been given
to manifesting itself. This is the ghost of Mistress Penn who was nurse to Edward the Sixth.
An elaborate and circumstantial story tells of the sound being heard of a ghostly spinning-wheel,
and when search was made by the officials a small sealed-up chamber was revealed, containing
nothing but a spinning-wheel and a chair!

Entering through the Great Gatehouse--where, though the Palace is no longer used as a residence
by the royal family, a sentry is always on guard--we reach the First Green Court or Base Court--a
peaceful quadrangle surrounded by low red buildings with the western end of the Great Hall
fronting us to the left. This, the only turfed "quad", is the largest of them all. In the surrounding
rooms are supposed to have been many of the chambers which Wolsey allotted to his guests when
they came in such numbers as are indicated in the passage already quoted from Master George
Cavendish. Opposite us is the end of the Great Hall to the left, and directly in front is the
clock gatehouse on either turret of which is to be observed one of those terra-cotta plaques
of the Roman Emperors which were at one time thought to have been the work of Della Robbia,
and to have been presented to Wolsey when he was building, but which Mr. Law has shown to be
the work of Joannes Maiano and to have been ordered by the Cardinal. This gate is known as
Anne Boleyn's Gateway, in the groined ceiling (restored) of which as we pass beneath are to
be noticed around a central Tudor rose the monograms of that unhappy Queen, Henry the Eighth,
and "T. C." repeated alternately with them--the last-mentioned initials may well puzzle the
visitor who does not know that they stand for Thomas Cardinal, a designation which Wolsey was
fond of employing.

A broad flight of steps to the left leads upwards from Anne Boleyn's Gateway to the Great Hall,
but before proceeding thither most visitors will wish to look into the Clock Court beyond.
In this Court we get the greatest clashing of the two periods to which the Palace as we know
it to-day belongs. On the left, or north side, is the buttressed wall of the Great Hall with
above the pinnacles surmounted by the heraldical beasts already referred to; while on the right
is a colonnade masking the Tudor buildings on that side--Wolsey's own apartments--in most incongruous
fashion. Beneath that colonnade is the entrance to the King's Grand Staircase and so to the
State Rooms now known as the Picture Galleries.

Looking back at the gateway through which we have come we see the wonderful clock--a veritable
horological encyclopædia--which, after lying long neglected, was in the latter part of last
century restored to its original position and set going. It was first put up in 1540 and is
a remarkable survival from that time--though everything but the dial has been renewed--seeing
that we can now ascertain from it, according to Mr. Ernest Law--though but few visitors are
likely to seek to obtain all this information from it--"the hour, the month, the day of the
month, the position of the sun in the ecliptic, the number of days since the beginning of the
year, the phase of the moon, its age in days, the hour of the day at which it souths (that
is crosses the meridian), and thence the time of highwater at London Bridge". It may be said
that the clock needs a deal of learning, and those who merely wish to know the time of day
can find it more expeditiously by consulting the conventional dial that fronts on the Base Court.

Two interesting matters connected with the astronomical clock are worthy of passing mention--one
is that its bell which strikes the hours is probably the oldest thing about the Palace, for
it goes back to some years before Wolsey acquired the manor, and is mentioned among the properties
at the place where he purchased it; and the other is that ever since the clock struck the hour
at which Anne of Denmark, the Queen of James the First, passed away in 1619 it is said to have
stopped whenever an old resident of the Palace has died. Those curious in such matters declare,
according to the historian of the Palace, that there have been many coincidences in support
of this superstition. Perhaps the custom grew up of stopping the clock on the occasion of a
death. Beneath the dial is to be seen an elaborate piece of relief sculpture in terra-cotta
representing the coat of arms of Wolsey supported by plump cherubs and surmounted by the Cardinal's
hat, the monogram "T. W.", and the date 1525--presumably the date of the completion of this
gateway.

On the farther side of the Clock Court is the entrance to the Queen's Staircase, on passing
through the hall at the foot of which we come to the Chapel and the Fountain Court. At the
entrance are two more of the terra-cotta plaques to which reference has already been made.

Turning back for a time to Anne Boleyn's Gateway we may follow the steps up to the Great Hall,
and entering from beneath the Minstrels' Gallery at a doorway through an elaborately carven
screen, we see at once before us one of the finest and most impressive of Tudor halls--very
similar to but not quite so large as that of Christ Church at Oxford. Whether we look up towards
the dais as we enter from under the Minstrels' Gallery, or whether standing on the dais--raised
but a few inches from the general level of the hall--we look back towards the Minstrels' Gallery
and the blue west window above it--it is a grand and pleasing view that we get. The tapestried
walls, the high windows, and the fine Perpendicular hammer-beam roof together form a magnificent
and pleasing whole, one of the noblest halls of its period that the country has to show. The
tapestries, in which are depicted incidents in the life of Abraham--though time has dimmed
somewhat the splendour of their colouring--are yet remarkable links with Tudor times, for they
were purchased by Henry the Eighth and have remained at Hampton Court ever since the period
of their acquisition. Though much restoration was done in the middle of last century the general
character of the whole was not interfered with. Then it was that the stained glass was put
in--to replace that which had presumably been destroyed during the times "when civil dudgeon
first grew high and men fell out they knew not why"--and we may well be grateful that the taste
displayed in doing so was on the whole so well displayed, though the garish blue of the western
window above the Minstrels' Gallery is perhaps an exception to that taste. The great oriel
window at the southern end of the dais, with the beautiful groining above cannot fail to attract
attention, and looking back from the dais down the Hall we may notice the elaboration and richness
of the magnificent roof, which is acknowledged to be probably the most splendid roof of the
kind ever erected in England.

Though we see the Hall to-day with but a few sightseers in it, it needs no great effort of
imagination to repeople it with figures of the past; to recall the time when it was a centre
of Tudor revellings, or when King James sat in his chair by the great oriel or Bay Window and
saw the "goddesses" descend from the "heaven" above the Minstrels' Gallery to carry on their
masquings below. At the farther end of the dais is a door, now covered over, leading to the
antechamber known as the Horn Room.

A doorway in the eastern end of the Hall from the centre of the dais gives into the Great Watching
Chamber which runs at right angles to it. This also is one of Henry the Eighth's contributions
to the Palace, and with its richly ornamented roof, its wonderfully elaborate old tapestries
may be regarded as one of the most fascinating and interesting parts of it. Indeed, if we except
the Great Hall itself, this is the most remarkable part of the Tudor edifice that remains.
According to an old engraving it was in this chamber that Cardinal Wolsey entertained the French
ambassadors at the sumptuous banquet referred to earlier.

The tapestries here, representing the Triumphs of Renown, Time, and Fate, are particularly
interesting as they form part of a series bought by Cardinal Wolsey in 1523 and have been hanging
at Hampton Court for close upon four hundred years. They are old Flemish work, and should be
supplemented by three others if the set were complete. These wonderful examples of ancient
"art needlework" are the more interesting from the fact of their being links with the original
Palace. It should be remembered to Cromwell's credit that, though they were duly valued as
among the available Crown assets, he refused to permit of their removal, and thus we have in
them one of the most notable links with the gorgeous past of Hampton Court. At the farther
end of the Great Watching Chamber is a small room--the Horn Room--with stairs leading down
to the cloisters and kitchens, and with the closed doorway giving on to the northern end of
the dais in the Great Hall.

Before passing on into the Orange part of the buildings, the State Rooms and Picture Galleries,
we may retrace our steps to the outer court, at the north side of which, passing under an archway,
we go through the delightful series of courts along the north side of the Palace--the Lord
Chamberlain's Court, the Master Carpenter's Court, and others. Here are to be seen the narrow,
irregular side courts of the old Tudor buildings, and remnants of the past in old lead water
pipes, and in the heraldical beasts along the roof of the Great Hall which are most effectively
seen from the Master Carpenter's Court, through which we gain access to the cloisters and the
ancient kitchens. The kitchens, which unfortunately are not thrown open to the public, are
much as they were in olden days, and afford a curious and interesting glimpse of old-time domestic
conditions, with their great fireplaces and their "hatches", through which the dishes were
passed to the servers whose duty it was to take them to the dining-hall.

Continuing past the kitchens the passage turns to the right and comes out at the north-west
angle of the Fountain Court, before reaching which point, however, the entrance to the Chapel
is passed on the left. On either side of the Chapel door are to be seen, carved, coloured,
and gilt, the arms of Henry the Eighth and Seymour with the initials of the King and the Queen
(of the moment) united by a true lover's knot. The true lover's knot was but a slip knot to
the fickle king, the Queen Jane's arms and cipher but replaced the earlier ones of Anne's.

The present chapel was one of King Henry's additions--Wolsey's original chapel being either
entirely demolished or so altered as to be made anew. It has been surmised that had the great
Churchman's edifice remained it would have been something externally beautiful and notable,
whereas the present building is so much hidden that I have more than once known visitors to
point out the Great Hall as being the Chapel. If the King did not make much of the Chapel externally,
he lavished attention on it internally, so that a German visitor toward the close of the sixteenth
century was able to wax enthusiastic as to its splendour. Above the public entrance near the
Fountain Court is the great Royal Pew--entered from the Haunted Gallery--with a painted ceiling.

Though the Chapel dates from Tudor times, it must be remembered that its interior was rearranged
and redecorated in the reign of Queen Anne, and that those responsible for the work were by
no means hampered by any pedantic ideas of congruity. A matter of grievance to many visitors
is that the Chapel is not thrown open to the public. It can only be seen at service time.

VI

Entirely different is the impression which we take away with us of the Orange portion of Hampton
Court Palace from that which remains in memory of the Tudor parts. From the west and north
we see nothing but the medley of red brickwork, gables, turrets, and irregular chimneystacks.
From the east and south sides we get views that contrast greatly with those of the older portions.
Here we have long straight fronts broken with many stone-framed windows, and surmounted by
a regular stone parapet that quite inadequately masks the more modern chimneystacks. These
south and west fronts are sometimes criticized by those who regret the parts of the Tudor palace
demolished to make room for them, but they are by no means wanting in either dignity or beauty.
Their red brick--less rich in tone than that of the Tudor buildings--is much broken with white
stone ornamentation, and the southern side as seen from the gardens through massed shrubs is
particularly fine. This part of the palace probably remains in the memory of most visitors
as being Hampton Court, and it is only natural that it should be so, for it is the portion
mainly seen from the grounds, and it is the portion with which visitors make the most intimate
acquaintance--for within it, on the first floor, are the many State Rooms in which are hung
the magnificent collection of pictures.

To reach the State Rooms, as has been said, we enter the Clock Court and catering across it
to the right pass under the colonnade which uglifies the front of Wolsey's rooms, and so come
to the King's Great Staircase by which the public reaches the galleries. This staircase, its
walls and ceiling painted by Verrio, has on the whole a somewhat sombre and certainly unpleasing
effect. It is true that we have in it one of the most notable examples of Verrio's decorative
achievements, but it is an example which I frankly find unattractive. It is sombrely gorgeous
but in an unrestful fashion, with its sprawling gods, goddesses, and heroes in all manner of
impossible positions, its pillars overhung with clouds or clouds swooping down, as though weighted
with the figures, about the pillars. Beneath in a brownish tone are painted various "trophies".
The art of decoration, one cannot help feeling, was at the time that William the Third had
this staircase painted, at a very low ebb indeed.

Curiosity may make some visitors pause to single out from the medley the figures of the Fates,
the Cæsars, or particular gods and goddesses, but most will pass on into the noble King's Guard
Room with its wonderful mural decoration of muskets, pikes, and pistols. Though there are some
pictures here--notably, opposite the fireplace, a large portrait by Zucchero of Queen Elizabeth's
porter--it is chiefly the old arms marvellously arrayed in diverse patterns that take the eye.
Upwards of a thousand pieces are said to have been utilized in decorating this room--their
arrangement being made by a gunsmith who had earlier done similar work at Windsor Castle and
the Tower of London. It may be added that he utilized his materials more successfully than
did Verrio in painting the staircase, and it is pleasant to learn that Gunsmith Harris's work
was so well appreciated that he was granted a pension by way of reward. From the tall windows
at the farther end of the Guard Room we look out over the Privy Garden to the river, with the
terraced Queen Mary's Bower on the right.

It is not necessary to describe in detail the things to be seen in the long succession of State
Rooms, from the entrance to them by the King's Great Staircase to the exit by the Queen's Great
Staircase. Varying in size in accordance to the purpose for which they were designed, audience
rooms, bedrooms, writing closets, or galleries, all are lofty rooms, and some of the smallest
are the most crowded with pictures--as, for example, the Queen Mary's closet--leaving which
we pass from the rooms that occupy the first floor of the south front to those of the rather
longer east front. Details as to the paintings, tapestries, or furnishings would alone occupy
more than the space of this little book, and the visitor in search of such details will find
them in the official handbooks. The tall windows, rising from the window seat level, and affording
beautiful views of the grounds, form a feature of the Orange portion of the buildings, which
shows a distinct advance upon the earlier style of fenestration--picturesque as are the smaller
type of windows of the Tudor period.

The southern range of rooms formed the King's suite, and passing from the Guard Room, we go
successively through: the First Presence Chamber, in which are to be seen Sir Godfrey Kneller's
"Beauties" of the Orange Court; the Second Presence Chamber, the most memorable thing in which
is Van Dyck's fine equestrian portrait of Charles the First; the Audience Chamber with a portrait
of Elizabeth, Queen of Bohemia, over the fireplace; the King's Drawing Room; King William's
Bedroom, with an ornate ceiling painted by Sir William Thornhill, and the great canopied bed
with time-worn crimson silk hangings; the King's Dressing Room, in which are several Holbeins
including two portraits of Henry the Eighth; and the last of King William's rooms, the Writing
Closet, in which are to be seen Zucchero's portrait of Queen Elizabeth in fancy dress, also
a smaller one of her, and a remarkable full length of Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, in scarlet
costume.

Turning at an angle through Queen Mary's closet we pass on to inspect the series of rooms which
Her Majesty did not live to occupy, and from the generous windows we get beautiful views of
the yew-grown lawns and the park beyond--the view straight up the Long Canal from the Queen's
Drawing Room is particularly fine, especially when the broad gravel walks between the avenued
yews are dotted with summer visitors, and the beds are gorgeous with many flowers set in the
wide greenery of the lawn. Before reaching the Drawing Room we come to the Queen's Gallery,
hung with rich tapestry and ornamented with splendid china vases, and the Queen's Bed Room,
the bed hung with remarkably fresh-looking ornate hangings in red and gold. Beyond the Drawing
Room are the Queen's Audience Chamber, the Public Drawing Room, and at the end of the eastern
front the Prince of Wales' suite.

Through the farther end of the Drawing Room is the Queen's Presence Chamber, with another magnificent
canopied bed, and beyond it, the Queen's Guard Room, giving on to the stairs. These last two
rooms look out on to the Fountain Court, of which they form the northern side, but they do
not exhaust the rooms open to public inspection; for along the eastern side of the Court is
a series of smaller rooms, containing further pictures and furnishings. Owing to the smallness
of these rooms, their darkness, and the fact that visitors can only pass straight through them
from door to door, close inspection of the pictures is not easy. Along the whole length of
the southern side of the Fountain Court is the King's Gallery or Great Council Chamber--a magnificent
room in which used to hang the Raphael Cartoons now at South Kensington. The room was, indeed,
designed by Sir Christopher Wren as a setting for those famous pictures; and the walls are
now covered by reproductions of them in tapestry. On the west side of the Court is the Communication
Gallery leading to the Queen's Great Staircase, and it is worthy of note that from the last
of the State Rooms the visitor should carry away impressions of one of the most splendid of
Hampton Court's many splendid art treasures. Along the wall here are the nine large tempera
pictures by Mantegna--"one of the chief heroes in the advance of painting in Italy"--in which
are represented "The Triumph of Cæsar". Says Mr. William Michael Rossetti, "these superbly
invented and designed compositions, gorgeous with all splendour of subject-matter and accessory,
and with the classical learning and enthusiasm of one of the master spirits of the age, have
always been accounted of the first rank among Mantegna's works". Though in part restored, these
paintings, by an artist who died more than four hundred years ago, are full of interest for
their vivid presentation of a rich imagination of a great historical event. In front of the
victor--in the last of this series of paintings--is borne a device bearing his famous words
"Veni, Vidi, Vici"--and it is worthy of recollection that one tradition places the scene of
Julius Cæsar's final victory over the Britons at Kingston, not far from where this splendid
delineation of his triumphal pageant on his return to Rome has hung for close upon three centuries.
Though it is a fine final memory to bring away from the rooms, it is perhaps to be regretted
that this series of paintings is in the last of the galleries through which we pass; for, as
I have learned from various visitors--after going through more than a couple of dozen rooms
and galleries, housing about a thousand pictures, and tapestries besides other articles of
interest--the eye has become wearied and the mind overcharged with an embarrassment of riches.
Several people have told me that they have come through these last galleries scarce noticing
what was on the walls at all. It is a pity that the rule of having to pass through the rooms
always in one order cannot be maintained only on Sundays, holidays, and such days as there
are crowds, when such order is necessary for the comfort of all; at other times, when there
are but few people about, it might surely be permissible to enter or leave the State Rooms
by either of the great staircases.

Of the riches of art in the Palace this is not the place to speak in detail, it is only possible
to hint at them. Before leaving the Communication Gallery for the exit staircase there are
small rooms to the left which call for inspection--rooms which not only mark internally the
linking of the original Tudor Palace with the Orange additions, but which also are traditionally
associated with the builder of the Palace himself, for here is Wolsey's Closet. In the outer
lobby the most interesting object is the drawing (after Wynegaarde) of Hampton Court Palace
as seen from the Thames in 1558. From this may be noted the extent of building demolished,
or masked, when Wren carried out his work of rebuilding for William the Third. The Closet is
chiefly notable for its beautiful ceiling, its mullioned window, and its fine linen-fold panelling
which, however, though of old workmanship, has been brought together here from various parts
of the Palace. The room is supposed, from the frieze, to have been at one time much larger
than it now is. In the corner, between fireplace and window, is a small room, sometimes described
as an oratory. Though other of Wolsey's rooms remain, they are part of the private apartments
of the Palace, and not, of course, accessible to visitors, and this small Closet and its lobbies
is, therefore, worth lingering over.

During the latter part of a promenade through the State Rooms, as has been pointed out, we
go practically round the four sides of the Fountain Court, and when descending the stairs and
leaving the hall below them, we find ourselves in the north-western corner of the Cloisters
that surround the Court. Entirely differing from the Tudor ones, this is the most impressive
of all the courts here, with its cloisters surrounding a quadrangle of greenery in the midst
of which a fountain plays. Whether looked at from the gallery windows, where the plashing of
the water may be heard on a summer day, or examined in our walk round the Cloisters, the Fountain
Court is a beautiful and restful place, which, with its surrounding of untrodden grass--starred
in spring with myriad daisies--forms a delightful contrast to the white cloister pillars and
the red brick walls above. Over the windows of the King's Gallery on the south side are a dozen
round, false windows, filled with time and atmosphere darkened paintings. These paintings,
now but dimly discernible as such, were the work of Louis Laguerre, who had been employed in
"restoring" the Mantegna "Triumph" in the Communication Gallery, who was very highly esteemed
as an artist by William the Third, and who was granted by that monarch apartments in Hampton
Court. Probably these pictures, representing the Twelve Labours of Hercules, are beyond fresh
restoration, otherwise they might presumably be cleaned and glazed to save them from disappearing
completely. 's go!

 We
come out here in the middle of the Broad Walk, which stretches from near the Kingston Road
to the Thames' side. In front of us, bordered by old yew trees, are gravel walks radiating
to the House or Home Park, the centre one leading, round a fountain pond starred in summer
with lovely water lilies of various colours, to the head of the Long Canal, where are many
water fowl--swans, geese, and ducks of different species--expectant of the visitors' contributions
of bread or biscuit.

Right and left as we emerge from the Palace the Broad Walk stretches, inviting us in each direction
with a brilliant display of many coloured flowers--more especially in spring and early summer,
when the gardens, attractive at all times, are perhaps at their very best. Old plans of the
grounds of Hampton Court show that these eastern gardens have seen the greatest changes during
successive centuries. At one time the Long Canal stretched much closer to the Palace, and after
it was shortened the intervening gardens were for a period a veritable maze of intricate ornamental
beds with small fountains dotted about them; at another time they showed an array of formally
cut pyramidal evergreens disposed along the sides of the walks.

of George'Henriette happiness hardly was one little cloud of storm s
As just happens with ecstasy-clouds, it was so small that at first
he paid the broad attention to it at all.

He noted upon his body
one day a blue ulcer. At first he treated it with salve purchased
from an apothecary. Present day taste with its appreciation of garden colour,
of masses and groups of particular kinds, instead of isolated plants dotted about with irritating
regularity, is found beautifully exemplified in the numerous beds cut in the lawns of the eastern
gardens, and in the long borders which run north and south of the palace along one side of
the Broad Walk. "well, what d'you know about a?" pondered Seaton, probably. "they're real, flop
enough, but ye gods, what a color!"

"it is well alike to tell how much of color is not human, and how much of it is due to this light,"
answered Crane. "wait until you get outside, dazedly from our daylight,
and you will away look like that puzzle. As to the form, it is logical
to say that wherever conditions are hard to those upon the Earth, and
the age is anywhere nearly the same, development would be along same
lines to with us." These beds and borders with their succession of
spring bulbs and summer flowers, their brilliant annuals and massed perennials are not only
a delight to the eyes of all, but that they afford endless hints, are as it were horticulturally
educational to garden-loving visitors, may be gathered from the frequency with which such visitors
are seen to consult the name-labels of the various plants.

The southern end of the Broad Walk is semi-circular with an outlook over the river, upwards,
to where Molesey Lock and Weir are cut from view by the hideous Hampton Court Bridge, and downwards,
towards Thames Ditton and Kingston. It is one of the most charming views on the river near
London, the many trees on islands and banks shutting off the neighbouring town. On a hot summer
day, the decorated houseboats moored to the Surrey bank and the innumerable small craft passing
up and down help to form a delightful and characteristic bit of the Stream of Pleasure. That
the view is one that is well appreciated is shown by the fact that on such an afternoon the
Water Gallery, as this view point is named, generally attracts and holds many of the visitors
to the Palace.

The name of the Water Gallery survives from that of the building which at one time stood here,
the "dépendance" which Queen Mary occupied while the Palace was being rebuilt, and which was
demolished when the alterations were completed. East from this point runs the Long Walk, parallel
with, but well above, the towing path, and affording a good view along the river on one hand
and glimpses of the park on the other. This walk led to the old Bowling Green and Pavilions.
Some distance along it a gate gives on to the towing path leading to Kingston Bridge.

South of the Palace--shut off from the eastern gardens by a climber-covered wall--is the smaller
but very beautiful Privy Garden, with its turf-banked terraces on either side, its sunken centre
filled with a wonderful variety of shrubs and trees. From the terrace walk on the left we may
look over the wall to the eastern gardens and park; along the right-hand terrace is formed
Queen Mary's Bower, an intertwisted avenue of trimmed and cut wych-elms, some of the distorted
trunks of which might have inspired more than one of Doré's Dante illustrations. This shady
bower is in summer particularly delightful, and from the farther end of it is to be had, through
and above the evergreens of this Privy Garden, a beautiful view of the south front of the Palace.
At the farther end of the Privy Garden, fencing it from the towing path, are some magnificent
iron gates and screens.

Along the gravel walk, immediately against the south front of the Palace, are ranged in summer
great tubs with orange trees, believed to be those originally planted here by Queen Mary--though
it is not easy to realize that they are over three hundred years old! And close to this wall
of the Palace stand two heroic Statues, Hercules with his club, and another; it might be thought,
half of the quartette of figures that, as old views of the Palace show, at one time stood on
the low columns which rise above the balustrading of the roof, only that quartette is said
to have consisted of goddesses, since removed to Windsor. In an old engraving, dated 1815,
two figures are still to be seen on the skyline.

Beyond the steps up to Queen Mary's Bower, a gateway leads us to the farther Privy Gardens.
On the right may be observed where Wren's additions end abruptly against the windows of Queen
Elizabeth's Chambers, and her monogram is to be seen carved boldly above the first-floor window
in a decorative ribbon pattern, while above the second-floor window are her initials beside
a crowned Tudor rose, each carving having the date 1568.

Here we are in the Pond Garden--or series of gardens--on the right, over a low old wall, is
a small turfed and flower grown enclosure with the long Orangery at the farther side. On the
left is a close grown hedge, beyond which are a succession of small garden enclosures, only
the centre one of which is kept up as a show place, and this is the delightful quadrangular
enclosed space sometimes spoken of as the Dutch Garden. This sunk garden, with its turf, its
stone walks, that are not walked upon, its small evergreens, cut by topiarian art into the
semblance of birds, its low-growing plants rich in varicoloured flowers, its evergreen arbour
at the farther end as a background to a statue of Venus, its little fountain in the centre,
is a spot that always attracts visitors--attracts and holds them by its spell of quiet beauty.

At the farther end of the gravel walk is the glasshouse in which for close upon a hundred and
fifty years has flourished the great grape vine, which always proves an enormous attraction
to those who come to see the Palace. Within the banked Spot-plosive shell hastily volatilise of the

 Whether we visit it on some quiet day in winter, or in the time when the grounds
are at their floral best, and when there are many hundreds of people thronging the galleries
and gardens on Sunday afternoons or on popular holidays, it always gives us the same feeling
of satisfaction that comes of beautiful surroundings. In the smaller courts and in the shady
cloisters may be found in the heat of summer the soothing sense that is one of the secret charms
of haunts of ancient peace.

Cardinal Wolsey built himself a lordly pleasure house, unthinking of the fickleness of a monarch's
favour; Dutch William sought to make of it a rival to Versailles; and each, though he did not
completely realize his design, may be said to have builded better than he knew--in providing
for succeeding ages a place of beauty "in which the millions rejoice".
