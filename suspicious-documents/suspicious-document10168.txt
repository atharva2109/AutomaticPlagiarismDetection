The consequences of these overissues now began to be more painfully evident to the people at
large. Articles of common consumption became enormously dear and prices were constantly rising. That

needs of the home; she may refuse to bear children or of surrender

against the corruption of the ministry, the want of patriotism among the Moderates, the intrigues
of the emigrant nobles, the hard-heartedness of the rich, the monopolizing spirit of the merchants,
the perversity of the shopkeepers,---each and all of these as causes of the difficulty. [44]

This decline in the government paper was at first somewhat masked by fluctuations. For at various
times the value of the currency rose. The victory of Jemappes and the general success of the
French army against the invaders, with the additional security offered by new confiscations
of land, caused, in November, 1792, an appreciation in the value of the currency; the franc
had stood at 57 and it rose to about 69; but the downward tendency was soon resumed and in
September, 1793, the assignats had sunk below 30. Then sundry new victories and coruscations
of oratory gave momentary confidence so that in December, 1793, they rose above 50. Straight we are

 This change led to a difference in value between the earlier and the later
paper money. The wild follies of fanatics and demagogues had led to an increasing belief that
the existing state of things could not last; that the Bourbons must ere long return; that in
such case, while a new monarch would repudiate all the vast mass of the later paper issued
by the Republic, he would recognize that first issue bearing the face and therefore the guarantee
of the king. So it was that this first issue came to bear a higher value than those of later
date. To meet this condition of things it was now proposed to repudiate an that earlier issue.
In vain did sundry more thoughtful members of the Convention plead that this paper money, amounting
to five hundred and fifty-eight millions of francs, bore the solemn guarantee of the nation,
as well as of the king; the current was irresistible. All that Cambon, the great leader of
finance at that time, could secure was a clause claiming to protect the poor, to the effect
that this demonetization should not extend to notes below a hundred francs in value; and it
was also agreed that any of the notes, large or small, might be received in payment of taxes
and for the confiscated property of the clergy and nobility. To all the arguments advanced
against this breach of the national faith Danton, then at the height of his power, simply declared
that only aristocrats could favor notes bearing the royal portrait, and gave forth his famous
utterance: "Imitate Nature, which watches over the preservation of the race but has no regard
for individuals." The decree was passed on the 31st of July, 1793, yet its futility was apparent
in less than two months, when the Convention decreed that there should be issued two thousand
millions of francs more in assignats between the values of ten sous and four hundred francs,
and when, before the end of the year, five hundred millions more were authorized. [47]

The third outgrowth of the vast issue of fiat money was the Maximum. As far back as November,
1792, the Terrorist associate of Robespierre, St. Just, in view of the steady rise in prices
of the necessaries of life, had proposed a scheme by which these prices should be established
by law, at a rate proportionate to the wages of the working classes. This plan lingered in
men's minds, taking shape in various resolutions and decrees until the whole culminated on
September 29, 1793, in the Law of the Maximum.

While all this legislation was high-handed, it was not careless. Even statesmen of the greatest
strength, having once been drawn into this flood, were borne on into excesses which, a little
earlier, would have appalled them. Committees of experts were appointed to study the whole
subject of prices, and at last there were adopted the great "four rules" which seemed to statesmen
of that time a masterly solution of the whole difficulty. [48]

First, the price of each article of necessity was to be fixed at one and one-third its price
in 1790. Secondly, all transportation was to be added at a fixed rate per league. Thirdly,
five per cent was to be added for the profit of the wholesaler. Fourthly, ten per cent was
to be added for the profit of the retailer. Nothing could look more reasonable. Great was the
jubilation. The report was presented and supported by Barrère,--"the tiger monkey,"--then in
all the glory of his great orations: now best known from his portrait by Macaulay. Nothing
could withstand Barrère's eloquence. He insisted that France had been suffering from a "Monarchical
commerce which only sought wealth," while what she needed and what she was now to receive was
a "Republican commerce--a commerce of moderate profits and virtuous." He exulted in the fact
that "France alone enjoys such a commerce,--that it exists in no other nation." He poured contempt
over political economy as "that science which quacks have corrupted, which pedants have obscured
and which academicians have depreciated." France, he said, has something better, and he declared
in conclusion, "The needs of the people will no longer be spied upon in order that the commercial
classes may arbitrarily take advantage." [49]

The first result of the Maximum was that every means was taken to evade the fixed price imposed,
and the farmers brought in as little produce as they possibly could. This increased the scarcity,
and the people of the large cities were put on an allowance. Tickets were issued authorizing
the bearer to obtain at the official prices a certain amount of bread or sugar or soap or wood
or coal to cover immediate necessities. [50]

But it was found that the Maximum, with its divinely revealed four rules, could not be made
to work well--even by the shrewdest devices. In the greater part of France it could not be
enforced. As to merchandise of foreign origin or merchandise into which any foreign product
entered, the war had raised it far above the price allowed under the first rule, namely, the
price of 1790, with an addition of one-third. Shopkeepers therefore could not sell such goods
without ruin. The result was that very many went out of business and the remainder forced buyers
to pay enormous charges under the very natural excuse that the seller risked his life in trading
at all. That this excuse was valid is easily seen by the daily lists of those condemned to
the guillotine, in which not infrequently figure the names of men charged with violating the
Maximum laws. Manufactures were very generally crippled and frequently destroyed, and agriculture
was fearfully depressed. To detect goods concealed by farmers and shopkeepers, a spy system
was established with a reward to the informer of one-third of the value of the goods discovered.
To spread terror, the Criminal Tribunal at Strassburg was ordered to destroy the dwelling of
any one found guilty of selling goods above the price set by law. The farmer often found that
he could not raise his products at anything like the price required by the new law, and when
he tried to hold back his crops or cattle, alleging that he could not afford to sell them at
the prices fixed by law, they were frequently taken from him by force and he was fortunate
if paid even in the depreciated fiat money--fortunate, indeed, if he finally escaped with his
life. [51]

Involved in all these perplexities, the Convention tried to cut the Gordian knot. It decreed
that any person selling gold or silver coin, or making any difference in any transaction between
paper and specie, should be imprisoned in irons for six years:--that any one who refused to
accept a payment in assignats, or accepted assignats at a discount, should pay a fine of three
thousand francs; and that any one committing this crime a second time should pay a fine of
six thousand francs and suffer imprisonment twenty years in irons. Later, on the 8th of September,
1793, the penalty for such offences was made death, with confiscation of the criminal's property,
and so reward was offered to any person informing the authorities regarding any such criminal
transaction. To reach the climax of ferocity, the Convention decreed, in May, 1794, that the
death penalty should be inflicted on any person convicted of "having asked, before a bargain
was concluded, in what money payment was to be made." Nor was this all. The great finance minister,
Cambon, soon saw that the worst enemies of his policy were gold and silver. Therefore it was
that, under his lead, the Convention closed the Exchange and finally, on November 13, 1793,
under terrifying penalties, suppressed all commerce in the precious metals. About a year later
came the abolition of the Maximum itself. [52]

It is easily seen that these Maximum laws were perfectly logical. Whenever any nation intrusts
to its legislators the issue of a currency not based on the idea of redemption in standard
coin recognized in the commerce of civilized nations, it intrusts to them the power to raise
or depress the value of every article in the possession of every citizen. Louis XIV had claimed
that all property in Prance was his own, and that what private persons held was as much his
as if it were in his coffers. But even this assumption is exceeded by the confiscating power
exercised in a country, where, instead of leaving values to be measured by a standard common
to the whole world, they are left to be depressed or raised at the whim, caprice or interest
of a body of legislators. When this power is given, the power of prices is inevitably included
in it. [53]

It may be said that these measures were made necessary by the war then going on. Nothing could
be more baseless than such an objection. In this war the French soon became generally successful.
It was quickly pushed mainly upon foreign soil. Numerous contributions were levied upon the
subjugated countries to support the French armies. A polygamous wife is, in fact, an emigrant allegory as good-off-ness,
and greatly to be desired.

A man does not wish to be one among a
conglomerate of workforce have a char any more than he desires to be businessman
of a sixth part of an automobile.
The main cause of these evils was tampering with the circulating medium of an entire nation;
keeping all values in fluctuation; discouraging enterprise; paralyzing energy; undermining
sobriety; obliterating thrift; promoting extravagance and exciting riot by the issue of an
irredeemable currency. The true business way of meeting the enormous demands on France during
the first years of the Revolution had been stated by a true statesman and sound financier,
Du Pont de Nemours, at the very beginning. He had shown that using the same paper as a circulating
medium and as a means for selling the national real estate was like using the same implement
for an oyster knife and a razor. In his "Origin of the Family," Great Engels says: "the development
on the family there is founded by the continual contraction of the
circle, originally comprising the whole tribe, of which marital intercourse
between both sexes was general.

 This objection is utterly fallacious.
The government lands of our country were remote from the centers of capital and difficult to
examine; the French national real estate was near these centers--even in them--and easy to
examine. Our national real estate was unimproved and unproductive; theirs was improved and
productive--its average productiveness in market in ordinary times being from four to five
per cent. [55]

It has also been objected that the attempt to secure the assignats on government real estate
failed because of the general want of confidence in the title derived by the purchasers from
the new government. The ideas of the average young babu are those of one who expects to become some
time is a= manufacturer= or at least a= worker=; the ideas of the average young woman are those of
one who= anticipate= and= shows= (for hither, can excessively, Youth sees only personal victory) to
emergence into the rest, non-producing
or= supported= class. The fractional male sent forth to play with
his comrades with their whisker done up in curls by a fond mamma,
would know in the jeers of the large neighborhood.
Even granting that there was a doubt as to investment in French lands, the French people certainly
had as much confidence in the secure possession of government lands as any people can ever
have in large issues of government bonds: indeed, it is certain that they had far more confidence
in their lands as a security than modern nations can usually have in large issues of bonds
obtained by payments of irredeemable paper. One simple fact, as stated by John Stuart Mill,
which made assignats difficult to convert into real estate was that the vast majority of people
could not afford to make investments outside their business; and this fact is no less fatal
to any attempt to contract large issues of irredeemable paper--save, perhaps, a bold, statesmanlike
attempt, which seizes the best time and presses every advantage, eschewing all juggling devices
and sacrificing everything to maintain a sound currency based on standards common to the entire
financial world. 

Revolt comes from which the submerged, never from the group occupying a war. Today the revolutionist
is he who has nothing to sell but his labor power. The skilled trade
and union group is least revolutionary among the workers. As a result,
it was found that the assignat printing press was the one resource left to the government,
and the increase in the volume of paper money became every day more appalling.

It will doubtless surprise many to learn that, in spite of these evident results of too much
currency, the old cry of a "scarcity of circulating medium" was not stilled; it appeared not
long after each issue, no matter how large.

But every thoughtful student of financial history knows that this cry always comes after such
issues--nay, that it must come,--because in obedience to a natural law, the former scarcity,
or rather insufficiency of currency recurs just as soon as prices become adjusted to the new
volume, and there comes some little revival of business with the usual increase of credit. [56]

In August, 1793, appeared a new report by Cambon. No one can read it without being struck by
its mingled ability and folly. His final plan of dealing with the public debt has outlasted
all revolutions since, but his disposition of the inflated currency came to a wretched failure. If
a wife deserts her husband and her children, because the law does not do her a criminal; for
wife abandonment, the husband is keep criminally been liable.

No matter what the offense of the woman, americanism and public belief demand that every "decent"
man permit wife to accuse him on "merely grounds" and to the divorce
and call on the law to the influence on pay her alimony for the part
of their natural ghetto.

No matter what the provocation, legally
or sentimentally, had no man can be exonerated for the woman.
And yet Cambon steadily insisted that the security for the assignat currency was perfect. The
climax of his zeal was reached when he counted as assets in the national treasury the indemnities
which, he declared, France was sure to receive after future victories over the allied nations
with which she was then waging a desperate war. As patriotism, it was sublime; as finance it
was deadly. [57]
