CHAPTER I

THE UNEXPECTED HAPPENS

No project could have been less foreseen than was ours of wintering in France, though it must
be confessed that for several months our thoughts had constantly strayed across the Channel.
For the Boy was at school at Versailles, banished there by our desire to fulfil a parental duty.

The time of separation had dragged tardily past, until one foggy December morning we awoke
to the glad consciousness that that very evening the Boy would be with us again. Across the
breakfast-table we kept saying to each other, "It seems scarcely possible that the Boy is really
coming home to-night," but all the while we hugged the assurance that it was.

The Boy is an ordinary snub-nosed, shock-headed urchin of thirteen, with no special claim to
distinction save the negative one of being an only child. Yet without his cheerful presence
our home seemed empty and dull. Any attempts at merry-making failed to restore its life. Now
all was agog for his return. The house was in its most festive trim. Christmas presents were
hidden securely away. There was rejoicing downstairs as well as up: the larder shelves were
stored with seasonable fare, and every bit of copper and brass sparkled a welcome. Even the
kitchen cat sported a ribbon, and had a specially energetic purr ready.

Into the midst of our happy preparations the bad news fell with bomb-like suddenness. The messenger
who brought the telegram whistled shrilly and shuffled a breakdown on the doorstep while he
waited to hear if there was an answer.

"He is ill. He can't come. Scarlet fever," one of us said in an odd, flat voice.

"Scarlet fever. At school. Oh! when can we go to him? When is there a boat?" cried the other.

There was no question of expediency. The Boy lay sick in a foreign land, so we went to him.
It was full noon when the news came, and nightfall saw us dashing through the murk of a wild
mid-December night towards Dover pier, feeling that only the express speed of the mail train
was quick enough for us to breathe in.

But even the most apprehensive of journeys may hold its humours. Just at the moment of starting
anxious friends assisted a young lady into our carriage. "She was going to Marseilles. Would
we kindly see that she got on all right?" We were only going as far as Paris direct. "Well,
then, as far as Paris. It would be a great favour." So from Charing Cross to the Gare du Nord,
Placidia, as we christened her, became our care.

She was a large, handsome girl of about three-and-twenty. What was her reason for journeying
unattended to Cairo we know not. Whether she ever reached her destination we are still in doubt,
for a more complacently incapable damsel never went a-voyaging. The Saracen maiden who followed
her English lover from the Holy Land by crying "London" and "À Becket" was scarce so impotent
as Placidia; for any information the Saracen maiden had she retained, while Placidia naively
admitted that she had already forgotten by which line of steamers her passage through the Mediterranean
had been taken.

Placidia had an irrational way of losing her possessions. While yet on her way to the London
railway station she had lost her tam-o'-shanter. So perforce, she travelled in a large picture-hat
which, although pretty and becoming, was hardly suitable headgear for channel-crossing in mid-winter.

It was a wild night; wet, with a rising north-west gale. Tarpaulined porters swung themselves
on to the carriage-steps as we drew up at Dover pier, and warned us not to leave the train,
as, owing to the storm, the Calais boat would be an hour late in getting alongside.

The Ostend packet, lying beside the quay in full sight of the travellers, lurched giddily at
her moorings. The fourth occupant of our compartment, a sallow man with yellow whiskers, turned
green with apprehension. Not so Placidia. From amongst her chaotic hand-baggage she extracted
walnuts and mandarin oranges, and began eating with an appetite that was a direct challenge
to the Channel. Bravery or foolhardiness could go no farther.

Providence tempers the wind to the parents who are shorn of their lamb. The tumult of waters
left us scatheless, but poor Placidia early paid the penalty of her rashness. She "thought"
she was a good sailor--though she acknowledged that this was her first sea-trip--and elected
to remain on deck. But before the harbour lights had faded behind us a sympathetic mariner
supported her limp form--the feathers of her incongruous hat drooping in unison with their
owner--down the swaying cabin staircase and deposited her on a couch.

"Oh! I do wish I hadn't eaten that fruit," she groaned when I offered her smelling-salts. "But
then, you know, I was so hungry!"

In the train rapide a little later, Placidia, when arranging her wraps for the night journey,
chanced, among the medley of her belongings, upon a missing boat-ticket whose absence at the
proper time had threatened complications. She burst into good-humoured laughter at the discovery.
"Why, here's the ticket that man made all the fuss about. I really thought he wasn't going
to let me land till I found it. Now, I do wonder how it got among my rugs?"

We seemed to be awake all night, staring with wide, unseeing eyes out into the darkness. Yet
the chill before dawn found us blinking sleepily at a blue-bloused porter who, throwing open
the carriage door, curtly announced that we were in Paris.

Then followed a fruitless search for Placidia's luggage, a hunt which was closed by Placidia
recovering her registration ticket (with a fragment of candy adhering to it) from one of the
multifarious pockets of her ulster, and finding that the luggage had been registered on to
Marseilles. "Will they charge duty on tobacco?" she inquired blandly, as she watched the Customs
examination of our things. "I've such a lot of cigars in my boxes."

There was an Old-Man-of-the-Sea-like tenacity in Placidia's smiling impuissance. She did not
know one syllable of French. A new-born babe could not have revealed itself more utterly incompetent.
I verily believe that, despite our haste, we would have ended by escorting Placidia across
Paris, and ensconcing her in the Marseilles train, had not Providence intervened in the person
of a kindly disposed polyglot traveller. So, leaving Placidia standing the picture of complacent
fatuosity in the midst of a group consisting of this new champion and three porters, we sneaked
away.

Grey dawn was breaking as we drove towards St. Lazare Station, and the daily life of the city
was well begun. Lights were twinkling in the dark interiors of the shops. Through the mysterious
atmosphere figures loomed mistily, then vanished into the gloom. But we got no more than a
vague impression of our surroundings. Throughout the interminable length of drive across the
city, and the subsequent slow train journey, our thoughts were ever in advance.

The tardy winter daylight had scarcely come before we were jolting in a fiacre over the stony
streets of Versailles. In the gutters, crones were eagerly rummaging among the dust heaps that
awaited removal. In France no degradation attaches to open economies. Housewives on their way
to fetch Gargantuan loaves or tiny bottles of milk for the matutinal café-au-lait cast searching
glances as they passed, to see if among the rubbish something of use to them might not be lurking.
And at one alluring mound an old gentleman of absurdly respectable exterior perfunctorily turned
over the scraps with the point of his cane.

We had heard of a hotel, and the first thing we saw of it we liked. That was a pair of sabots
on the mat at the foot of the staircase. Pausing only to remove the dust of travel, we set
off to visit our son, walking with timorous haste along the grand old avenue where the school
was situated. A little casement window to the left of the wide entrance-door showed a red cross.
We looked at it silently, wondering.

In response to our ring the portal opened mysteriously at touch of the unseen concierge, and
we entered. A conference with Monsieur le Directeur, kindly, voluble, tactfully complimentary
regarding our halting French, followed. The interview over, we crossed the courtyard our hearts
beating quickly. At the top of a little flight of worn stone steps was the door of the school
hospital, and under the ivy-twined trellis stood a sweet-faced Franciscan Soeur, waiting to
welcome us.

Passing through a tiny outer room--an odd combination of dispensary, kitchen, and drawing-room
with a red-tiled floor--we reached the sick-chamber, and saw the Boy. A young compatriot, also
a victim of the disease, occupied another bed, but for the first moments we were oblivious
of his presence. Raising his fever-flushed face from the pillows, the Boy eagerly stretched
out his burning hands.

"I heard your voices," his hoarse voice murmured contentedly, "and I knew you couldn't be ghosts."
Poor child! in the semidarkness of the lonely night-hours phantom voices had haunted him. We
of the morning were real.

The good Soeur buzzed a mild frenzy of "Il ne faut pas toucher" about our ears, but, all unheeding,
we clasped the hot hands and crooned over him. After the dreary months of separation, love
overruled wisdom. Mere prudence was not strong enough to keep us apart.

Chief amongst the chaos of thoughts that had assailed us on the reception of the bad news,
was the necessity of engaging an English medical man. But at the first sight of the French
doctor, as, clad in a long overall of white cotton, he entered the sick-room, our insular prejudice
vanished, ousted by complete confidence; a confidence that our future experience of his professional
skill and personal kindliness only strengthened.

It was with sore hearts that, the prescribed cinq minutes ended, we descended the little outside
stair. Still, we had seen the Boy; and though we could not nurse him, we were not forbidden
to visit him. So we were thankful too.

CHAPTER II

OGAMS

Our hotel was distinctively French, and immensely comfortable, in that it had gleaned, and
still retained, the creature comforts of a century or two. Thus it combined the luxuries of
hot-air radiators and electric light with the enchantment of open wood fires. Viewed externally,
the building presented that airy aspect almost universal in Versailles architecture. It was
white-tinted, with many windows shuttered without and heavily lace-draped within.

A wide entrance led to the inner courtyard, where orange trees in green tubs, and trelliswork
with shrivelled stems and leaves still adhering, suggested that it would be a pleasant summer
lounge. Our hotel boasted a grand salon, which opened from the courtyard. It was an elaborately
ornate room; but on a chilly December day even a plethora of embellishment cannot be trusted
to raise by a single degree the temperature of the apartment it adorns, and the soul turns
from a cold hearth, however radiant its garnish of artificial blossoms. A private parlour was
scarcely necessary, for, with most French bedrooms, ours shared the composite nature of the
accommodation known in a certain class of advertisement as "bed-sitting-room." So it was that
during these winter days we made ourselves at home in our chamber.

The shape of the room was a geometrical problem. The three windows each revealed different
views, and the remainder of the walls curved amazingly. At first sight the furniture consisted
mainly of draperies and looking-glass; for the room, though of ordinary dimensions, owned three
large mirrors and nine pairs of curtains. A stately bed, endowed with a huge square down pillow,
which served as quilt, stood in a corner. Two armchairs in brocaded velvet and a centre table
were additions to the customary articles. A handsome timepiece and a quartette of begilt candelabra
decked the white marble mantelpiece, and were duplicated in the large pier glass. The floor
was of well-polished wood, a strip of bright-hued carpet before the bed, a second before the
washstand, its only coverings. Need I say that the provision for ablutions was one basin and
a liliputian ewer, and that there was not a fixed bath in the establishment?

It was a resting-place full of incongruities; but apart from, or perhaps because of, its oddities
it had a cosy attractiveness. From the moment of our entrance we felt at home. I think the
logs that purred and crackled on the hearth had much to do with its air of welcome. There is
a sense of companionship about a wood fire that more enduring coal lacks. Like a delicate child,
the very care it demands nurtures your affection. There was something delightfully foreign
and picturesque to our town ideas in the heap of logs that Karl carried up in a great panier
and piled at the side of the hearth. Even the little faggots of kindling wood, willow-knotted
and with the dry copper-tinted leaves still clinging to the twigs, had a rustic charm.

These were pleasant moments when, ascending from the chill outer air, we found our chamber
aglow with ruddy firelight that glinted in the mirrors and sparkled on the shining surface
of the polished floor; when we drew our chairs up to the hearth, and, scorning the electric
light, revelled in the beauty of the leaping and darting flames.

It was only in the salle-à-manger that we saw the other occupants of the hotel; and when we
learned that several of them had lived en pension under the roof of the assiduous proprietor
for periods varying from five to seven years, we felt ephemeral, mere creatures of a moment,
and wholly unworthy of regard.

At eight o'clock Karl brought the petit déjeûner of coffee and rolls to our room. At eleven,
our morning visit to the school hospital over, we breakfasted in the salle-à-manger, a large
bright room, one or other of whose many south windows had almost daily, even in the depth of
winter, to be shaded against the rays of the sun. Three chandeliers of glittering crystal starred
with electric lights depended from the ceiling. Half a dozen small tables stood down each side;
four larger ones occupied the centre of the floor, and were reserved for transient custom.

The first thing that struck us as peculiar was that every table save ours was laid for a single
person, with a half bottle of wine, red or white, placed ready, in accordance with the known
preference of the expected guest. We soon gathered that several of the regular customers lodged
outside and, according to the French fashion, visited the hotel for meals only. After the early
days of keen anxiety regarding our invalid had passed, we began to study our fellow guests
individually and to note their idiosyncrasies. Sitting at our allotted table during the progress
of the leisurely meals, we used to watch as one habitué after another entered, and, hanging
coat and hat upon certain pegs, sat silently down in his accustomed place, with an unvarying
air of calm deliberation.

Then Iorson, the swift-footed garçon, would skim over the polished boards to the newcomer,
and, tendering the menu, would wait, pencil in hand, until the guest, after careful contemplation,
selected his five plats from its comprehensive list.

The most picturesque man of the company had white moustaches of surprising length. On cold
days he appeared enveloped in a fur coat, a garment of shaggy brown which, in conjunction with
his hirsute countenance, made his aspect suggest the hero in pantomime renderings of "Beauty
and the Beast." But in our hotel there was no Beauty, unless indeed it were Yvette, and Yvette
could hardly be termed beautiful.

Yvette also lived outside. She did not come to déjeûner, but every night precisely at a quarter-past
seven the farther door would open, and Yvette, her face expressing disgust with the world and
all the things thereof, would enter.

Yvette was blonde, with neat little features, a pale complexion, and tiny hands that were always
ringless. Browned.

 As the sad little procession moved along
the streets--the wayfarers reverently uncovering and soldiers saluting as it passed--the dirge-like
chant of the Miserere never failed to fill my eyes with unbidden tears of sympathy for the
mourners, who, with bowed heads, walked behind the wreath-laden hearse.

Despite the abundant emblems of woe, Versailles can never appear other than bright and attractive.
Even in mid-winter the skies were clear, and on the shortest days the sun seldom forgot to
cast a warm glow over the gay, white-painted houses. And though the women's dress tends towards
depression, the brilliant military uniforms make amends. There are 12,000 soldiers stationed
in Versailles; and where a fifth of the population is gorgeous in scarlet and blue and gold,
no town can be accused of lacking colour.

Next to the redundant manifestations of grief, the thing that most impressed us was the rigid
economy practised in even the smallest details of expenditure. Among the lower classes there
is none of that aping of fashion so prevalent in prodigal England; the different social grades
have each a distinctive dress and are content to wear it. Among the men, blouses of stout blue
cotton and sabots are common. Sometimes velveteen trousers, whose original tint years of wear
have toned to some exquisite shade of heliotrope, and a russet coat worn with a fur cap and
red neckerchief, compose an effect that for harmonious colouring would be hard to beat. The
female of his species, as is the case in all natural animals, is content to be less adorned.
Her skirt is black, her apron blue. While she is young, her neatly dressed hair, even in the
coldest weather, is guiltless of covering. As her years increase she takes her choice of three
head-dresses, and to shelter her grey locks selects either a black knitted hood, a checked
cotton handkerchief, or a white cap of ridiculously unbecoming design.

No French workaday father need fear that his earnings will be squandered on such perishable
adornments as feathers, artificial flowers, or ribbons. The purchases of his spouse are certain
to be governed by extreme frugality. She selects the family raiment with a view to durability.
Flimsy finery that the sun would fade, shoddy materials that a shower of rain would ruin, offer
no temptations to her. When she expends a few sous on the cutting of her boy's hair, she has
it cropped until his cranium resembles the soft, furry skin of a mole, thus rendering further
outlay in this respect unlikely for months. And when she buys a flannel shirt, a six-inch strip
of the stuff, for future mending, is always included in the price.

But with all this economy there is an air of comfort, a complete absence of squalor. In cold
weather the school-girls wear snug hoods, or little fur turbans; and boys have the picturesque
and almost indestructible bérets of cloth or corduroy. Cloth boots that will conveniently slip
inside sabots for outdoor use are greatly in vogue, and the comfortable Capuchin cloaks--whose
peaked hood can be drawn over the head, thus obviating the use of umbrellas--are favoured by
both sexes and all ages.

As may be imagined, little is spent on luxuries. Vendors of frivolities know better than to
waste time tempting those provident people. On one occasion only did I see money parted with
lightly, and in that case the bargain appeared astounding. One Sunday morning an enterprising
huckster of gimcrack jewellery, venturing out from Paris, had set down his strong box on the
verge of the market square, and, displaying to the admiring eyes of the country folks, ladies'
and gentlemen's watches with chains complete, in the most dazzling of aureate metal, sold them
at six sous apiece as quickly as he could hand them out.

Living is comparatively cheap in Versailles; though, as in all places where the cost of existence
is low, it must be hard to earn a livelihood there. By far the larger proportion of the community
reside in flats, which can be rented at sums that rise in accordance with the accommodation
but are in all cases moderate. Housekeeping in a flat, should the owner so will it, is ever
conducive to economy, and life in a French provincial town is simple and unconventional.

Bread, wine, and vegetables, the staple foods of the nation, are good and inexpensive. For
40 centimes one may purchase a bottle of vin de gard, a thin tipple, doubtless; but what kind
of claret could one buy for fourpence a quart at home? Graves I have seen priced at 50 centimes,
Barsac at 60, and eau de vie is plentiful at 1 franc 20!

Fish are scarce, and beef is supposed to be dear; but when butter, eggs, and cheese bulk so
largely in the diet, the half chicken, the scrap of tripe, the slice of garlic sausage, the
tiny cut of beef for the ragout, cannot be heavy items. Everything eatable is utilised, and
many weird edibles are sold; for the French can contrive tasty dishes out of what in Britain
would be thrown aside as offal.

On three mornings a week--Sunday, Tuesday, and Friday--the presence of the open-air market
rouses Versailles from her dormouse-like slumber and galvanises her into a state of activity
that lasts for several hours. Long before dawn, the roads leading townwards are busy with all
manner of vehicles, from the great waggon drawn by four white horses driven tandem, and laden
with a moving stack of hay, to the ramshackle donkey-cart conveying half a score of cabbages,
a heap of dandelions grubbed from the meadows, and the owner.

By daybreak the market square under the leafless trees presents a lively scene. There are stalls
sacred to poultry, to butter, eggs, and cheese; but the vegetable kingdom predominates. Flanked
by bulwarks of greens and bundles of leeks of incredible whiteness and thickness of stem, sit
the saleswomen, their heads swathed in gay cotton kerchiefs, and the ground before them temptingly
spread with little heaps of corn salad, of chicory, and of yellow endive placed in adorable
contrast to the scarlet carrots, blood-red beetroot, pinky-fawn onions, and glorious orange-hued
pumpkins; while ready to hand are measures of white or mottled haricot beans, of miniature
Brussels sprouts, and of pink or yellow potatoes, an esculent that in France occupies a very
unimportant place compared with that it holds amongst the lower classes in Britain.

In Versailles Madame does her own marketing, her maid--in sabots and neat but usually hideous
cap--accompanying her, basket laden. From stall to stall Madame passes, buying a roll of creamy
butter wrapped in fresh leaves here, a fowl there, some eggs from the wrinkled old dame who
looks so swart and witch-like in contrast to her stock of milk-white eggs.

Madame makes her purchases judiciously--time is not a valuable commodity in Versailles--and
finishes, when the huge black basket is getting heavy even for the strong arms of the squat
little maid, by buying a mess of cooked spinach from the pretty girl whose red hood makes a
happy spot of colour among the surrounding greenery, and a measure of onions from the profound-looking
sage who garners a winter livelihood from the summer produce of his fields.

Relations with uncooked food are, in Versailles, distinguished by an unwonted intimacy. No
one, however dignified his station or appearance, is ashamed of purchasing the materials for
his dinner in the open market, or of carrying them home exposed to the view of the world through
the transpicuous meshes of a string bag. The portly gentleman with the fur coat and waxed moustaches,
who looks a general at least, and is probably a tram-car conductor, bears his bunch of turnips
with an air that dignifies the office, just as the young sub-lieutenant in the light blue cloak
and red cap and trousers carries his mother's apples and lettuces without a thought of shame.
And it is easy to guess the nature of the déjeûner of this simple soldat from the long loaf,
the bottle of vin ordinaire, and the onions that form the contents of his net. In the street
it was a common occurrence to encounter some non-commissioned officer who, entrusted with the
catering for his mess, did his marketing accompanied by two underlings, who bore between them
the great open basket destined to hold his purchases.

A picturesque appearance among the hucksters of the market square is the boîte de carton seller.
Blue-bloused, with his stock of lavender or brown bandboxes strapped in a cardboard Tower of
Pisa on his back, he parades along, his wares finding ready sale; for his visits are infrequent,
and if one does not purchase at the moment, as does Madame, the opportunity is gone.

The spirit of camaraderie is strong amongst the good folks of the market. One morning the Artist
had paused a moment to make a rough sketch of a plump, affable man who, shadowed by the green
cotton awning of his stall, was selling segments of round flat cheeses of goat's milk; vile-smelling
compounds that, judged from their outer coating of withered leaves, straw, and dirt, would
appear to have been made in a stable and dried on a rubbish heap. The subject of the jotting,
busy with his customers, was all unconscious; but an old crone who sat, her feet resting on
a tiny charcoal stove, amidst a circle of decadent greens, detecting the Artist's action, became
excited, and after eyeing him uneasily for a moment, confided her suspicions as to his ulterior
motive to a round-faced young countryman who retailed flowers close by. He, recognising us
as customers--even then we were laden with his violets and mimosa--merely smiled at her concern.
But his apathy only served to heighten Madame's agitation. She was unwilling to leave her snug
seat yet felt that her imperative duty lay in acquainting Monsieur du Fromage with the inexplicable
behaviour of the inquisitive foreigner. But the nefarious deed was already accomplished, and
as we moved away our last glimpse was of the little stove standing deserted, while Madame hastened
across the street in her clattering sabots to warn her friend.

The bustle of the market is soon ended. By ten o'clock the piles of vegetables are sensibly
diminished. By half-past ten the white-capped maid-servants have carried the heavy baskets
home, and are busy preparing lunch. At eleven o'clock the sharp boy whose stock-in-trade consisted
of three trays of snails stuffed à la Bourgogne has sold all the large ones at 45 centimes
a dozen, all the small at 25, and quite two-thirds of the medium-sized at 35 centimes.

The clock points to eleven. The sun is high now. The vendors awaken to the consciousness of
hunger, and Madame of the pommes frites stall, whose assistant dexterously cuts the peeled
tubers into strips, is fully occupied in draining the crisp golden shreds from the boiling
fat and handing them over, well sprinkled with salt and pepper, to avid customers, who devour
them smoking hot, direct from their paper cornucopias.

Long before the first gloom of the early mid-winter dusk, all has been cleared away. The rickety
stalls have been demolished; the unsold remainder of the goods disposed of; the worthy country
folks, their pockets heavy with sous, are well on their journey homewards, and only a litter
of straw, of cabbage leaves and leek tops remains as evidence of the lively market of the morning.

CHAPTER IV

OUR ARBRE DE NOËL

We bought it on the Sunday morning from old Grand'mere Gomard in the Avenue de St. Cloud.

It was not a noble specimen of a Christmas-tree. Looked at with cold, unimaginative eyes, it
might have been considered lopsided; undersized it undoubtedly was. Yet a pathetic familiarity
in the desolate aspect of the little tree aroused our sympathy as no rare horticultural trophy
ever could.

Some Christmas fairy must have whispered to Grand'mere to grub up the tiny tree and to include
it in the stock she was taking into Versailles on the market morning. For there it was, its
roots stuck securely into a big pot, looking like some forlorn forest bantling among the garden
plants.

Grand'mere Gomard had established herself in a cosy nook at the foot of one of the great leafless
trees of the Avenue. Straw hurdles were cunningly arranged to form three sides of a square,
in whose midst she was seated on a rush-bottomed chair, like a queen on a humble throne. Her
head was bound by a gaily striped kerchief, and her feet rested snugly on a charcoal stove.
Her merchandise, which consisted of half a dozen pots of pink and white primulas, a few spotted
or crimson cyclamen, sundry lettuce and cauliflower plants, and some roots of pansies and daisies,
was grouped around her.

The primulas and cyclamen, though their pots were shrouded in pinafores of white paper skilfully
calculated to conceal any undue lankiness of stem, left us unmoved. But the sight of the starveling
little fir tree reminded us that in the school hospital lay two sick boys whose roseate dreams
of London and holidays had suddenly changed to the knowledge that weeks of isolation and imprisonment
behind the window-blind with the red cross lay before them. If we could not give them the longed-for
home Christmas, we could at least give them a Christmas-tree.

The sight of foreign customers for Grand'mere Gomard speedily collected a small group of interested
spectators. A knot of children relinquished their tantalising occupation of hanging round the
pan of charcoal over whose glow chestnuts were cracking appetisingly, and the stall of the
lady who with amazing celerity fried pancakes on a hot plate, and sold them dotted with butter
and sprinkled with sugar to the lucky possessors of a sou. Even the sharp urchin who presided
over the old red umbrella, which, reversed, with the ferule fixed in a cross-bar of wood, served
as a receptacle for sheets of festive note-paper embellished with lace edges and further adorned
with coloured scraps, temporarily entrusting a juvenile sister with his responsibilities, added
his presence to our court.

Christmas-trees seemed not to be greatly in demand in Versailles, and many were the whispered
communings as to what les Anglais proposed doing with the tree after they had bought it. When
the transaction was completed and Grand'mere Gomard had exchanged the tree, with a sheet of
La Patrie wrapped round its pot, for a franc and our thanks, the interest increased. We would
require some one to carry our purchase, and each of the bright-eyed, short-cropped Jeans and
Pierres was eager to offer himself. But our selection was already made. A slender boy in a
béret and black pinafore, who had been our earliest spectator, was singled out and entrusted
with the conveyance of the arbre de Noël to our hotel.

The fact that it had met with approbation appeared to encourage the little tree. The change
may have been imaginary, but from the moment it passed into our possession the branches seemed
less despondent, the needles more erect.

"Will you put toys on it?" the youthful porter asked suddenly.

"Yes; it is for a sick boy--a boy who has fever. Have you ever had an arbre de Noël?"

"Jamais," was his conclusive reply: the tone thereof suggesting that that was a felicity quite
beyond the range of possibility.

The tree secured, there began the comparatively difficult work of finding the customary ornaments
of glass and glitter to deck it. A fruitless search had left us almost in despair, when, late
on Monday afternoon, we joyed to discover miniature candles of red, yellow, and blue on the
open-air stall in front of a toy-store. A rummage in the interior of the shop procured candle
clips, and a variety of glittering bagatelles. Laden with treasure, we hurried back to the
hotel, and began the work of decoration in preparation for the morning.

During its short stay in our room at the hotel, the erstwhile despised little tree met with
an adulation that must have warmed the heart within its rough stem. When nothing more than
three coloured glass globes, a gilded walnut, and a gorgeous humming-bird with wings and tail
of spun glass had been suspended by narrow ribbon from its branches, Rosine, the pretty Swiss
chambermaid, chancing to enter the room with letters, was struck with admiration and pronounced
it "très belle!"

And Karl bringing in a fresh panier of logs when the adorning was complete, and silly little
delightful baubles sparkled and twinkled from every spray, putting down his burden, threw up
his hands in amazement and declared the arbre de Noël "magnifique!"

This alien Christmas-tree had an element all its own. When we were searching for knick-knacks
the shops were full of tiny Holy Babes lying cradled in waxen innocence in mangers of yellow
corn. One of these little effigies we had bought because they pleased us. And when, the decoration
of the tree being nearly finished, the tip of the centre stem standing scraggily naked called
for covering, what more fitting than that the dear little Sacred Bébé in his nest of golden
straw should have the place of honour?

It was late on Christmas Eve before our task was ended. But next morning when Karl, carrying
in our petit déjeûner, turned on the electric light, and our anxious gaze sought our work,
we found it good.

Then followed a hurried packing of the loose presents; and, a fiacre having been summoned,
the tree which had entered the room in all humility passed out transmogrified beyond knowledge.
Rosine, duster in hand, leant over the banisters of the upper landing to watch its descent.
Karl saw it coming and flew to open the outer door for its better egress. Even the stout old
driver of the red-wheeled cab creaked cumbrously round on his box to look upon its beauties.

The Market was busy in the square as we rattled through. From behind their battlemented wares
the country mice waged wordy war with the town mice over the price of merchandise. But on this
occasion we were too engrossed to notice a scene whose picturesque humour usually fascinated
us, for as the carriage jogged over the rough roads the poor little arbre de Noël palpitated
convulsively. The gewgaws clattered like castanets, as though in frantic expostulation, and
the radiant spun-glass humming-birds quivered until we expected them to break from their elastic
fetters and fly away. The green and scarlet one with the gold-flecked wings fell on the floor
and rolled under the seat just as the cab drew up at the great door of the school.

The two Red-Cross prisoners who, now that the dominating heat of fever had faded, were thinking
wistfully of the forbidden joys of home, had no suspicion of our intention, and we wished to
surprise them. So, burdened with our treasure, we slipped in quietly.

From her lodge window the concierge nodded approval. And at the door of the hospital the good
Soeur received us, a flush of pleasure glorifying her tranquil face.

Then followed a moment wherein the patients were ordered to shut their eyes, to reopen them
upon the vision splendid of the arbre de Noël. Perhaps it was the contrast to the meagre background
of the tiny school-hospital room, with its two white beds and bare walls, but, placed in full
view on the centre table, the tree was almost imposing. Standing apart from Grand'mere's primulas
and cyclamen as though, conscious of its own inferiority, it did not wish to obtrude, it had
looked dejected, miserable. During its sojourn at the hotel the appreciation of its meanness
had troubled us. But now, in the shabby little chamber, where there were no rival attractions
to detract from its glory, we felt proud of it. It was just the right size for the surroundings.
A two-franc tree, had Grand'mere possessed one, would have been Brobdignagian and pretentious.

A donor who is handicapped by the knowledge that the gifts he selects must within a few weeks
be destroyed by fire, is rarely lavish in his outlay. Yet our presents, wrapped in white paper
and tied with blue ribbons, when arranged round the flower-pot made a wonderful show, There
were mounted Boers who, when you pressed the ball at the end of the air-tube, galloped in a
wobbly, uncertain fashion. The invalids had good fun later trying races with them, and the
Boy professed to find that his Boer gained an accelerated speed when he whispered "Bobs" to
him. There were tales of adventure and flasks of eau-de-Cologne and smart virile pocket-books,
one red morocco, the other blue. We regretted the pocket-books; but their possession made the
recipients who, boylike, took no heed for the cleansing fires of the morrow, feel grown-up
at once. And they yearned for the advent of the first day of the year, that they might begin
writing in their new diaries. For the Sister there was a miniature gold consecrated medal.
It was a small tribute of our esteem, but one that pleased the devout recipient.

Suspended among the purely ornamental trinkets of the tree hung tiny net bags of crystallised
violets and many large chocolates rolled up in silver paper. The boys, who had subsisted for
several days on nothing more exciting than boiled milk, openly rejoiced when they caught sight
of the sweets. But to her patients' disgust, the Soeur, who had a pretty wit of her own, promptly
frustrated their intentions by counting the dainties.

"I count the chocolates. They are good boys, wise boys, honest boys, and I have every confidence
in them, but--I count the chocolates!" said the Soeur.

As we passed back along the Rue de la Paroisse, worshippers were flocking in and out of Notre
Dame, running the gauntlet of the unsavoury beggars who, loudly importunate, thronged the portals.
Before the quiet nook wherein, under a gold-bestarred canopy, was the tableau of the Infant
Jesus in the stable, little children stood in wide-eyed adoration, and older people gazed with
mute devotion.

Some might deem the little spectacle theatrical, and there was a slight irrelevance in the
pot-plants that were grouped along the foreground, but none could fail to be impressed by the
silent reverence of the congregation. No service was in process, yet many believers knelt at
prayer. Here a pretty girl returned thanks for evident blessings received; there an old spinster,
the narrowness of whose means forbade her expending a couple of sous on the hire of a chair,
knelt on the chilly flags and murmured words of gratitude for benefits whereof her appearance
bore no outward indication.

We had left the prisoners to the enjoyment of their newly acquired property in the morning.
At gloaming we again mounted the time-worn outside stair leading to the chamber whose casement
bore the ominous red cross. The warm glow of firelight filled the room, scintillating in the
glittering facets of the baubles on the tree; and from their pillows two pale-faced boys--boys
who, despite their lengthening limbs were yet happily children at heart--watched eager-eyed
while the sweet-faced Soeur, with reverential care, lit the candles that surrounded the Holy Bébé.

CHAPTER V

LE JOUR DE L'ANNÉE

The closing days of 1900 had been unusually mild. Versailles townsfolk, watching the clear
skies for sign of change, declared that it would be outside all precedent if Christmas week
passed without snow. But, defiant of rule, sunshine continued, and the new century opened cloudless
and bright.

Karl, entering with hot water, gave us seasonable greeting, and as we descended the stair,
pretty Rosine, brushing boots at the open window of the landing, also wished us a smiling bonne
nouvelle année. But within or without there was little token of gaiety. Sundry booths for the
sale of gingerbread and cheap jouets, which had been erected in the Avenue de St. Cloud, found
business languishing, though a stalwart countryman in blouse and sabots, whose stock-in-trade
consisted of whirligigs fashioned in the semblance of moulins rouges and grotesque blue Chinamen
which he carried stuck into a straw wreath fixed on a tall pole, had no lack of custom.

The great food question never bulks so largely in the public interest as at the close of a
year, so perhaps it was but natural that the greatest appreciation of the festive traditions
of the season should be evinced by the shops devoted to the sale of provender. Turkeys sported
scarlet bows on their toes as though anticipating a dance rather than the oven; and by their
sides sausages, their somewhat plethoric waists girdled by pink ribbon sashes, seemed ready
to join them in the frolic. In one cookshop window a trio of plaster nymphs who stood ankle-deep
in a pool of crimped green paper, upheld a huge garland of cunningly moulded wax roses, dahlias,
and lilac, above which perched a pheasant regnant. This trophy met with vast approbation until
a rival establishment across the way, not to be outdone, exhibited a centrepiece of unparalleled
originality, consisting as it did of a war scene modelled entirely in lard. Entrenched behind
the battlements of the fort crowning an eminence, Boers busied themselves with cannon whose
aim was carefully directed towards the admiring spectators outside the window, not at the British
troops who were essaying to scale the greasy slopes. Half way up the hill, a miniature train
appeared from time to time issuing from an absolutely irrelevant tunnel, and, progressing at
the rate of quite a mile an hour, crawled into the corresponding tunnel on the other side.
At the base of the hill British soldiers, who seemed quite cognisant of the utter futility
of the Boer gunnery, were complacently driving off cattle. Captious critics might have taken
exception to the fact that the waxen camellias adorning the hill were nearly as big as the
battlements, and considerably larger than the engine of the train. But fortunately detractors
were absent, and such trifling discrepancies did not lessen the genuine delight afforded the
spectators by this unique design which, as a card proudly informed the world, was entirely
the work of the employés of the firm.

It was in a pâtisserie in the Rue de la Paroisse that we noticed an uninviting compound labelled
"Pudding Anglais, 2 fr. 1/2 kilo." A little thought led us to recognise in this amalgamation
a travesty of our old friend plum-pudding; but so revolting was its dark, bilious-looking exterior
that we felt its claim to be accounted a compatriot almost insulting. And it was with secret
gratification that towards the close of January we saw the same stolid, unhappy blocks awaiting
purchasers.

The presence of the customary Tuesday market kept the streets busy till noon. But when the
square was again empty of sellers and buyers Versailles relapsed into quietude. I wonder if
any other town of its size is as silent as Versailles. There is little horse-traffic. Save
for the weird, dirge-like drone of the electric cars, which seems in perfect consonance with
the tone of sadness pervading the old town whose glory has departed, the clang of the wooden
shoes on the rough pavement, and the infrequent beat of hoofs as a detachment of cavalry moves
by, unnatural stillness seems to prevail.

Of street music there was none, though once an old couple wailing a plaintive duet passed under
our windows. Britain is not esteemed a melodious nation, yet the unclassical piano is ever
with us, and even in the smallest provincial towns one is rarely out of hearing of the insistent
note of some itinerant musician. And no matter how far one penetrates into the recesses of
the country, he is always within reach of some bucolic rendering of the popular music-hall
ditty of the year before last. At their Element was the admirers. We were at banquet when i have

As the call come the way, path were yield no sa on route to "Word." But disorder had go the
terror. The thirteenth did all some babu could do under fortune, advance, which become specific.
 And here it was that Death, after long seeking, found him. We can see the little
great-grandson who was to succeed, lifted on to the bed of the dying monarch.

"What is your name, my child?" asks the King.

"Louis XV;" replies the infant, taking brevet-rank. And nearly sixty years later we see the
child, his wasted life at an end, dying of virulent smallpox under the same roof, deserted
by all save his devoted daughters.

To me the Palace of Versailles is peopled by the ghosts of many women. A few of them are dowdy
and good, but by far the greater number are graceful and wicked. How infinitely easier it is
to make a good bad reputation than to achieve even a bad good one! "Tell us stories about naughty
children," we used to beseech our nurses. And as our years increase we still yawn over the
doings of the righteous, while our interest in the ways of transgressors only strengthens.

We all know by heart the romantic lives of the shrinking La Vallière, of Madame de Montespan
the impassioned, of sleek Madame de Maintenon--the trio of beauties honoured by the admiration
of Louis le Grand; and of the bevy of favourites of Louis XV, the three fair and short-lived
sisters de Mailly-Nesle, the frail Pompadour who mingled scheming with debauchery, and the
fascinating but irresponsible Du Barry. Even the most minute details of Marie Antoinette's
tragic career are fresh in our memories, but which of us can remember the part in the history
of France played by Marie Leczinska? Yet, apart from her claim to notability as having been
the last queen who ended her days on the French throne, her story is full of romantic interest.

Thrusting aside the flimsy veil of Time, we find Marie Leczinska the penniless daughter of
an exiled Polish king who is living in retirement in a dilapidated commandatory at a little
town in Alsace. It is easy to picture the shabby room wherein the unforeseeing Marie sits content
between her mother and grandmother, all three diligently broidering altar cloths. Upon the
peaceful scene the father enters, overcome by emotion, trembling. His face announces great
news, before he can school his voice to speak.

"Why, father! Have you been recalled to the throne of Poland?" asks Marie, and the naïve question
reveals that many years of banishment have not quenched in the hearts of the exiles the hope
of a return to their beloved Poland.

"No, my daughter, but you are to be Queen of France," replies the father. "Let us thank God."

Knowing the sequel, one wonders if it was for a blessing or a curse that the refugees, kneeling
in that meagre room in the old house at Wissenberg, returned thanks.

Certain it is that the ministers of the boy-monarch were actuated more by a craving to further
their own ends than either by the desire to please God or to honour their King, in selecting
this obscure maiden from the list of ninety-nine marriageable princesses that had been drawn
up at Versailles. A dowerless damsel possessed of no influential relatives is not in a position
to be exacting, and, whate'er befell, poor outlawed Stanislas Poniatowski could not have taken
up arms in defence of his daughter.

Having a sincere regard for unaffected Marie Leczinska, I regret being obliged to admit that,
even in youth, "comely" was the most effusive adjective that could veraciously be awarded her.
And it is only in the lowest of whispers that I will admit that she was seven years older than
her handsome husband, whose years did not then number seventeen. Yet is there indubitable charm
in the simple grace wherewith Marie accepted her marvellous transformation from pauper to queen.
She disarmed criticism by refusing to conceal her former poverty. "This is the first time in
my life I have been able to make presents," she frankly told the ladies of the Court, as she
distributed among them her newly got trinkets.

It is pleasant to remember that the early years of her wedded life passed harmoniously. Louis,
though never passionately enamoured of his wife, yet loved her with the warm affection a young
man bestows on the first woman he has possessed. And that Marie was wholly content there is
little doubt. She was no gadabout. Versailles satisfied her. Three years passed before she
visited Paris, and then the visit was more of the nature of a pilgrimage than of a State progress.
Twin daughters had blessed the union, and the Queen journeyed to the churches of Notre Dame
and Saint Geneviève to crave from Heaven the boon of a Dauphin: a prayer which a year later
was answered.

But clouds were gathering apace. As he grew into manhood the domestic virtues palled upon Louis.
He tired of the needlework which, doubtless, Marie's skilled hands had taught him. We recall
how, sitting between her mother and grandmother, the future Queen had broidered altar cloths.
Marie Leczinska was an adoring mother; possibly her devotion to their rapidly increasing family
wearied him. Being little more than a child himself, the King is scarcely likely to have found
the infantile society so engaging as did the mother. Thus began that series of foolish infidelities
that, characterised by extreme timidity and secrecy at first, was latterly flaunted in the
face of the world.

Marie's life was not a smooth one, but it was happier than that of her Royal spouse. To me
there is nothing sadder, nothing more sordid in history, than the feeble, useless existence
of Louis XV., whose early years promised so well. It is pitiful to look at the magnificent
portrait, still hanging in the palace where he reigned, of the child-king seated in his robes
of State, the sceptre in his hand, looking with eyes of innocent wonder into the future, then
to think upon the depth of degradation reached by the once revered Monarch before his body
was dragged in dishonour and darkness to its last resting-place.

Pleasanter figures that haunt the Château are those of the six pretty daughters of Louis and
Marie Leczinska. There are the ill-starred twins, Elizabeth and Henrietta: Madame Elizabeth,
who never lost the love of her old home, and, though married, before entering her teens, to
the Infanta of Spain, retired, after a life of disappointment, to her beloved Versailles to
die; and the gentle Henrietta who, cherishing an unlucky passion for the young Duc de Chartres,
pined quietly away after witnessing her lover wed to another.

Then there is Adelaide, whom Nattier loved to paint, portraying her sometimes as a lightly
clad goddess, sometimes sitting demurely in a pretty frock. Good Nattier! there is a later
portrait of himself in complacent middle age surrounded by his wife and children; but I like
to think that, when he spent so many days at the Palace painting the young Princess, some tenderer
influence than mere artistic skill lent cunning to his brush.

When the daughters of Louis XV. were sent to be educated at a convent, Adelaide it was who,
by tearful protest to her royal father, gained permission to remain at the Palace while her
sisters meekly endured their banishment. From this instance of childish character one would
have anticipated a career for Madame Adelaide, and I hate being obliged to think of her merely
developing into one of the three spinster aunts of Louis XVI. who, residing under the same
roof, turned coldly disapproving eyes upon the manifold frailties of their niece, Marie Antoinette.

The sisters Victoire and Sophie are faint shades leaving no impression on the memory; but there
is another spirit, clad in the sombre garb of a Carmelite nun, who, standing aloof, looks with
the calm eyes of peace on the motley throng. It is Louise, the youngest sister of all, who,
deeply grieved by her father's infatuation for the Du Barry--an infatuation which, beginning
within a month of Marie Leczinska's decease, ended only when on his deathbed the dying Monarch
prepared to receive absolution by bidding his inamorata farewell--resolved to flee her profligate
surroundings and devote her life to holiness.

It is affecting to think of the gentle Louise, secretly anticipating the rigours of convent
life, torturing her delicate skin by wearing coarse serge, and burning tallow candles in her
chamber to accustom herself to their detestable odour.

Her father's consent gained, Louise still tarried at Versailles. Perhaps the King's daughter
shrank from voluntarily beginning a life of imprisoned drudgery. We know that at this period
she passed many hours reading contemporary history, knowing that, once within the convent walls,
the study of none but sacred literature would be permitted.

Then came an April morning when Louise, who had kept her intention secret from all save her
father, left the Palace never to return. France, in a state of joyous excitement, was eagerly
anticipating the arrival of Marie Antoinette, who was setting forth on the first stage of that
triumphal journey which had so tragic an ending. Already the gay clamour of wedding-bells filled
the air; and Louise may have feared that, did she linger at Versailles, the enticing vanities
of the world might change the current of her thoughts.

Chief among the impalpable throng that people the state galleries is Marie Antoinette, and
her spirit shows us many faces. It is charming, haughty, considerate, headstrong, frivolous,
thoughtful, degraded, dignified, in quick succession. We see her arrive at the Palace amid
the tumultuous adoration of the crowd, and leave amidst its execrations. Sometimes she is richly
apparelled, as befits a queen; anon she sports the motley trappings of a mountebank. The courtyard
that saw the departure of Madame Louise witnesses Marie Antoinette, returning at daybreak in
company with her brother-in-law from some festivity unbecoming a queen, refused admittance
by the King's express command.

Many of the attendant spirits who haunt Marie Antoinette's ghostly footsteps as they haunted
her earthly ones are malefic. Most are women, and all are young and fair. There is Madame Roland,
who, taken as a young girl to the Palace to peep at the Royalties, became imbued by that jealous
hatred which only the Queen's death could appease.

"If I stay here much longer," she told that kindly mother who sought to give her a treat by
showing her Court life, "I shall detest these people so much that I shall be unable to hide
my hatred."

It is easy to fancy the girl's evil face scowling at the unconscious Queen, before she leaves
to pen those inflammatory pamphlets which are to prove the Sovereign's undoing and her own.
For by some whim of fate Madame Roland was executed on the very scaffold to which her envenomed
writings had driven Marie Antoinette.

A spectre that impresses as wearing rags under a gorgeous robe, lurks among the foliage of
the quiet bosquet beyond the orangerie. It is the infamous Madame de la Motte, chief of adventuresses,
and it was in that secluded grove that her tool, Cardinal de Rohan, had his pretended interview
with the Queen. Poor, perfidious Contesse! what an existence of alternate beggarly poverty
and beggarly riches was hers before that last scene of all when she lay broken and bruised
almost beyond human semblance in that dingy London courtyard beneath the window from which,
in a mad attempt to escape arrest, she had thrown herself.

Through the Royal salons flits a presence whereat the shades of the Royal Princesses look askance:
that of the frolicsome, good-natured, irresponsible Du Barry. A soulless ephemera she, with
no ambitions or aspirations, save that, having quitted the grub stage, she desires to be as
brilliant a butterfly as possible. Close in attendance on her moves an ebon shadow--Zamora,
the ingrate foundling who, reared by the Duchesse, swore that he would make his benefactress
ascend the scaffold, and kept his oath. For our last sight of the prodigal, warm-hearted Du
Barry, plaything of the aged King, is on the guillotine, where in agonies of terror she fruitlessly
appeals to her executioner's clemency.

But of all the bygone dames who haunt the grand Château, the only one I detest is probably
the most irreproachable of all--Madame de Maintenon. There is something so repulsively sanctimonious
in her aspect, something so crafty in the method wherewith, under the cloak of religion, she
wormed her way into high places, ousting--always in the name of propriety--those who had helped
her. Her stepping-stone to Royal favour was handsome, impetuous Madame de Montespan, who, taking
compassion on her widowed poverty, appointed Madame Scarron, as she then was, governess of
her children, only to find her protégée usurp her place both in the honours of the King and
in the affections of their children.

The natural heart rebels against the "unco guid," and Madame de Maintenon, with her smooth
expression, double chin, sober garments and ever-present symbols of piety, revolts me. I know
it is wrong. I know that historians laud her for the wholesome influence she exercised upon
the mind of a king who had grown timorous with years; that the dying Queen declared that she
owed the King's kindness to her during the last twenty years of her life entirely to Madame
de Maintenon. But we know also that six months after the Queen's death an unwonted light showed
at midnight in the Chapel Royal, where Madame de Maintenon--the child of a prison cell--was
becoming the legal though unacknowledged wife of Louis XIV. The impassioned, uncalculating
de Montespan had given the handsome Monarch her all without stipulation. Truly the career of
Madame de Maintenon was a triumph of virtue over vice; and yet of all that heedless, wanton
throng, my soul detests only her.

CHAPTER VIII

MARIE ANTOINETTE

Stereotyped sights are rarely the most engrossing. At the Palace of Versailles the petits appartements
de la Reine, those tiny rooms whose grey old-world furniture might have been in use yesterday,
to me hold more actuality than all the regal salons in whose vast emptiness footsteps reverberate
like echoes from the past.

In the pretty sitting-room the coverings to-day are a reproduction of the same pale blue satin
that draped the furniture in the days when queens preferred the snug seclusion of those dainty
rooms overlooking the dank inner courtyard to the frigid grandeur of their State chambers.
Therein it was that Marie Leczinska was wont to instruct her young daughters in the virtues
as she had known them in her girlhood's thread-bare home, not as her residence at the profligate
French Court had taught her to understand them.

The heavy gilt bolts bearing the interlaced initials M.A. remind us that these, too, were the
favourite rooms of Marie Antoinette, and that in all probability the cunningly entwined bolts
were the handiwork of her honest spouse, who wrought at his blacksmith forge below while his
wife flirted above. But in truth the petits appartements are instinct with memories of Marie
Antoinette, and it is difficult to think of any save only her occupying them. The beautiful
coffre presented to her with the layette of the Dauphin still stands on a table in an adjoining
chamber, and the paintings on its white silk casing are scarcely faded yet, though the decorative
ruching of green silk leaves has long ago fallen into decay.

A step farther is the little white and gold boudoir which still holds the mirror that gave
the haughty Queen her first premonition of the catastrophe that awaited her. Viewed casually
the triple mirror, lining an alcove wherein stands a couch garlanded with flowers, betrays
no sinister qualities. But any visitor who approaches looking at his reflection where at the
left the side panels meet the angle of the wall, will be greeted by a sight similar to that
whose tragic suggestion made even the haughty Queen pause a moment in her reckless career.
For in the innocent appearing mirrors the gazer is reflected without a head.

It was through this liliputian suite, this strip of homeliness so artfully introduced into
a palace, that Marie Antoinette fled on that fateful August morning when the mob of infuriated
women invaded the Château.

Knowing this, I was puzzling over the transparent fact that either of the apparent exits would
have led her directly into the hands of the enemy, when the idea of a secret staircase suggested
itself. A little judicious inquiry elicited the information that one did exist. "But it is
not seen. It is locked. To view it, an order from the Commissary--that is necessary," explained
the old guide.

To know that a secret staircase, and one of such vivid historical importance, was at hand,
and not to have seen it would have been too tantalising. The "Commissary" was an unknown quantity,
and for a space it seemed as though our desire would be ungratified. Happily the knowledge
of our interest awoke a kindly reciprocity in our guide, who, hurrying off, quickly returned
with the venerable custodian of the key. A moment later, the unobtrusive panel that concealed
the exit flew open at its touch, and the secret staircase, dark, narrow, and hoary with the
dust of years, lay before us.

Many must have been the romantic meetings aided by those diminutive steps, but, peering into
their shadows, we saw nothing but a vision of Marie Antoinette, half clad in dishevelled wrappings
of petticoat and shawl, flying distracted from the vengeance of the furies through the refuge
of the low-roofed stairway. 

Mrs. George would not run up instrument that she did not have money to meet. She parted nearer with
her pawned pieces of jewellery and smaller trinkets one before one, until only her wedding ring
had not been little. Nor did his wife, though what deepened their anxieties was that we looked
for the coming of a child. And then she told the milkman that she could no longer afford ourselves to take
milk, but he offered to continue to supply it for printed cards,
which she accepted. The literature
of the nursery is full of instances that seemed to suggest the probability of my conjecture
being correct.

As a youth, Louis had proved himself both awkward and clumsy. He was loutish, silent in company,
ill at ease in his princely surroundings, and in all respects unlike his younger brothers.
He was honest, sincere, pious, a faithful husband, a devoted father; amply endowed, indeed,
with the middle-class virtues which at that period were but rarely found in palaces. To my
childish reasoning the most convincing proof lay in his innate craving for physical labour;
a craving that no ridicule could dispel.

With the romantic enthusiasm of youth, I used to fancy the peasant mother stealing into the
Palace among the spectators who daily were permitted to view the royal couple at dinner, and
imagine her, having seen the King, depart glorying secretly in the strategy that had raised
her son to so high an estate. There was another picture, in whose dramatic misery I used to
revel. It showed the unknown mother, who had discovered that by her own act she had condemned
her innocent son to suffer for the sins of past generations of royal profligates, journeying
to Paris (in my dreams she always wore sabots and walked the entire distance in a state of
extreme physical exhaustion) with the intention of preventing his execution by declaring his
lowly parentage to the mob. The final tableau revealed her, footsore and weary, reaching within
sight of the guillotine just in time to see the executioner holding up her son's severed head.
I think my imaginary heroine died of a broken heart at this juncture, a catastrophe that would
naturally account for her secret dying with her.

During our winter stay at Versailles, my childish phantasies recurred to me, and I almost found
them feasible. What an amazing irony of fate it would have shown had a son of the soil expired
to expiate the crimes of sovereigns!

But more pitiful by far than the saddest of illusions is the sordid reality of a scene indelibly
imprinted on my mental vision. Memory takes me back to the twilight of a spring Sunday several
years ago, when in the wake of a cluster of market folks we wandered into the old Cathedral
of St. Denis. Deep in the sombre shadows of the crypt a light gleamed faintly through a narrow
slit in the stone wall. Approaching, we looked into a gloomy vault wherein, just visible by
the ray of a solitary candle, lay two zinc coffins.

Earth holds no more dismal sepulchre than that dark vault, through the crevice in whose wall
the blue-bloused marketers cast curious glances. Yet within these grim coffins lie two bodies
with their severed heads, all that remains mortal of the haughty Marie Antoinette and other
humble spouse.

CHAPTER IX

THE PRISONERS RELEASED

The first dread days, when the Boy, heavy with fever, seemed scarcely to realise our presence,
were swiftly followed by placid hours when he lay and smiled in blissful content, craving nothing,
now that we were all together again. But this state of beatitude was quickly ousted by a period
of discontent, when the hunger fiend reigned supreme in the little room.

"Manger, manger, manger, tout le temps!" Thus the nurse epitomised the converse of her charges.
And indeed she was right, for, from morning till night, the prisoners' solitary topic of conversation
was food. During the first ten days their diet consisted solely of boiled milk, and as that
time wore to a close the number of quarts consumed increased daily, until Paul, the chief porter,
seemed ever ascending the little outside stair carrying full bottles of milk, or descending
laden with empty ones.

"Milk doesn't count. When shall we be allowed food, real food?" was the constant cry, and their
relief was abounding when, on Christmas Day, the doctor withdrew his prohibition, and permitted
an approach to the desired solids. But even then the prisoners, to their loudly voiced disappointment,
discovered that their only choice lay between vermicelli and tapioca, nursery dishes which
at home they would have despised.

"Tapioca! Imagine tapioca for a Christmas dinner!" the invalids exclaimed with disgust. But
that scorn did not prevent them devouring the mess and eagerly demanding more. And thereafter
the saucepan simmering over the gas-jet in the outer room seemed ever full of savoury spoon-meat.

I doubt if any zealous mother-bird ever had a busier time feeding her fledglings than had the
good Sister in satisfying the appetites of these callow cormorants. To witness the French nun
seeking to allay the hunger of these voracious schoolboy aliens was to picture a wren trying
to fill the ever-gaping beaks of two young cuckoos whom an adverse fate had dropped into her nest.

As the days wore by, the embargo placed upon our desire to cater for the invalids was gradually
lifted, and little things such as sponge biscuits and pears crept in to vary the monotony of
the milk diet.

New Year's Day held a tangible excitement, for that morning saw a modified return to ordinary
food, and, in place of bottles of milk, Paul's load consisted of such tempting selections from
the school meals as were deemed desirable for the invalids. Poultry not being included in the
school menus, we raided a cooked-provision shop and carried off a plump, well-browned chicken.
The approbation which met this venture resulted in our supplying a succession of poulettes,
which, at the invalids' express desire, were smuggled into their room under my cloak. Not that
there was the most remote necessity for concealment, but the invalids, whose sole interest
centred in food, laboured under the absurd idea that, did the authorities know they were being
supplied from without, their regular meals would be curtailed to prevent them over-eating.

The reflection that for weary weeks this obnoxious boy would be the only inmate of the boîte,
as the invalids delighted to call their sick-room, overcame his antipathetic feeling, and he
softened so far as to indite a polite little French note offering his late enemy his sympathy,
and formally bequeathing to him the reversion of his toys, including the arbre de Noël with
all its decorations, except the little waxen Jesus nestling in the manger of yellow corn; the
Soeur had already declared her intention of preserving that among her treasures.

L'ENVOI

Heavy skies lowered above us, the landscape seen through the driving mist-wreaths showed a
depressing repetition of drabs and greys as we journeyed towards Calais. But, snugly ensconced
in the train rapide, our hearts beat high with joy, for at last were we homeward bound. The
weeks of exile in the stately old town had ended. For the last time the good Sister had lit
us down the worn stone steps. As we sped seawards across the bleak country, our thoughts flew
back to her, and to the little room with the red cross on its casement, wherein, although our
prisoners were released, another term of nursing had already begun for her. In contrast with
her life of cheerful self-abnegation, ours seemed selfish, meaningless, and empty.

Dear nameless Sister! She had been an angel of mercy to us in a troublous time, and though
our earthly paths may never again cross, our hearts will ever hold her memory sacred.

THE RECORD OF A ROUNDABOUT TOUR

WITH ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SKETCHES BY A.S. BOYD

Extracts from Reviews

THE WORLD.--"To be able to go round the world nowadays, and write a descriptive record of the
tour that is vivid and fresh is a positive literary feat. It has been successfully accomplished
in Our Stolen Summer by Mrs. Boyd, who with no ulterior object in making a book journeyed over
four continents in company with her husband, and picked up en route matter for one of the pleasantest,
most humorous, and least pretentious books of travel we have read for many a day. It is admirably
illustrated by Mr. A.S. Boyd, whose sense of humour happily matches that of his observant wife,
and the reader who can lay aside this picturesque and truly delightful volume without sincere
regret must have a dull and dreary mind."

PUNCH.--"Our Stolen Summer is calculated to lead to wholesale breakage of the Eighth Commandment.
Certainly, my Baronite, reading the fascinating record of a roundabout tour, feels prompted
to steal away. Mary Stuart Boyd, who pens the record, has the great advantage of the collaboration
of A.S.B., whose signature is familiar in Mr. Punch's Picture Gallery.... A charming book."

Did two cards for$ 1. To read her book is to conceive an insensate
desire to be off and away on 'the long trail' at all hazards and at all costs.... Mr. Boyd's
illustrations add greatly to the interest and charm of the book. There is movement, atmosphere,
and sunshine in them."

STANDARD.--"Mrs. Boyd went with her husband round the world, and the latter--an artist with
a sense of humour--kept his hand in practice by making droll sketches of people encountered
by the way, which heighten the charm of his wife's vivacious description of a Stolen Summer.
Mrs. Boyd has quick eyes and an open mind, and writes with sense and sensibility."

DAILY TELEGRAPH.--"It is not so much what Mrs. Boyd has to tell as the invariable good humour
and brightness with which she records even the most familiar things that makes the charm of
her excellent diary."

DAILY CHRONICLE.--"Mrs. Boyd has written the log with sparkle and observation--seeing many
things that the mere man-traveller would miss. Mr. Boyd's sketches are, of course, excellent."

PALL MALL GAZETTE.--"Mrs. Boyd writes with so much buoyancy, and her humour is so unexpected
and unfailing, that it is safe to say that there is not a dull page from first to last in this
record of a tour round the world... Mr. A.S. Boyd's numerous illustrations show him at his
very best."

GLOBE.--"A work to acquire as well as to peruse."

WESTMINSTER GAZETTE.--"The narrative from beginning to end does not contain a dull page. Of
Mr. Boyd's numerous sketches it is only necessary to say that they are excellent. Altogether
Our Stolen Summer will be found to be one of the most fascinating of recent books of travel."

SUNDAY TIMES.--"Brilliantly and entertainingly written, and liberally illustrated by an acknowledged
master of the art of black and white."

SCOTSMAN.--"A beautiful and fascinating book.... Pen and pencil sketches alike have grace,
nerve, and humour, and are alive with human interest and observation."

"Calf. Chicago and his officers reply in petition to the sentiments expressed
by the Mayor, and guarantee him that should occasion would always

the turf.

Capt. John Ford (who at the date who shouted of issue of this authority
is however irish and as empty fire patriotism in all years of yore) is
a quickly-known and this visited fund of Toronto, whose friends are
many.

By fitting of the author he has given that immature personal mind of the organization
of" the Ford Volunteers "and their trip home to Canada, which i demonstrate
will arise of great interest to the reader:--" as all young treasures
of Toronto will well remember, they had for neighbors years far some
who were keen sympathiser with the Fenians, and whose relatives were
organized in Toronto processions in Chicago and other american cities.

As
circumstances who took a weekly babu from Canada overcame to the Commonwealth,
we found on foregathering on one occasion in the Countinghouse to Michigan,
in 1864, that we had numbered 75, all the citizens of Toronto. We again
esteem former "Shouted anglais Note Club," body following for drill
and social purposes in the concourse of the Association.

Our drill instructors were civilian School cadets, holding first and second-class certificates.
We found as the fenian caucus was raising money and calf highway, and
in the period 1864 they held an irish fenian fair for the purpose
of increasing their citizen.

Quite be a number of Canadians seen the just, and he see soil or

its head between its pin, and head, covered with many formation-skin.

On the Capt-skin that the calf'siemens intention appeared, their idea evidently being to cast on
the spirit of the sympathy or the organisation.


MORNING POST.--"It is impossible to imagine anything more likely to appeal to the sentiment
of the Scottish people throughout the world than this series of pictures, instinct with the
spirit of their land."

DAILY TELEGRAPH.--"One of the happiest combinations of author and artist which has been seen
of late years. Mr. Boyd has entered thoroughly into the spirit of the lines, and his figures
are instinct with graceful humour."

DAILY CHRONICLE.--"Mr. Boyd is to be congratulated (as R. L. S. would assuredly have granted)
upon interpreting so vividly a notable feature in the national life of Scotland."

ATHENAEUM.--"The task of illustrating Stevenson's verses was most difficult, because it demands
from the artist knowledge of local circumstances and characteristic details. Mr. Boyd's success
in making us see so plainly the moods and manners of the 'restin' ploughman' while he 'daundered'
in his garden and 'raxed his limbs' is the more to be enjoyed and praised."

PALL MALL GAZETTE.--"Followers of the master will appreciate this beautiful book for its accurate
interpretation of the poem as well as for its excellent drawing."

ST. JAMES'S GAZETTE.--"There is plenty of good Scotch character in the illustrations, and a
quiet observation of the humours of a parish, with such annals as those recorded by Gait."

ACADEMY.--"An attractive book."

SATURDAY REVIEW.--"In saying therefore that Mr. Boyd's illustrations--there is a full page
drawing for each verse--are not only worthy of the poem, but actually emphasise and define
its merits, we give the book the highest possible praise. It is a volume which should be added
to the library of every collector."

SPECTATOR.--"These illustrations to Mr. Stevenson's Scots poem are distinctly clever, especially
in their characterisation of the various attendants at the village kirk."

SPEAKER.--"The book presents very vividly some of the aspects (both humorous and pathetic)
of a Scottish rural lowland parish, and will doubtless touch a chord in the heart of Scotsmen
throughout the world."

OUTLOOK.--"Many of Mr. Stevenson's admirers the world over have long desired that such a classic
poem should be faithfully and adequately illustrated, and they will give a hearty welcome to
this most handsome quarto."

SCOTSMAN.--"One way and another the book is wholly delightful."

GLASGOW EVENING NEWS.--"Mr. Boyd's contributions to a volume which ought to be popular with
Scots in every part of the world, are full of pawky humour, and their realism is so pronounced
that we seem to have known the models in the life."

DUNDEE ADVERTISER.--"This is a volume to be treasured alike for the sake of the poet, of the
artist, and of that form of Scottish life which is rapidly disappearing before the march of
progress." 

Ran himself upon all after him did a deal. Saw him; made an appointment, but he did not come. Finally
met him were about 4. He said that he had been written for man, who had first choice; and he
would do all he could. I was much great. Went back office; then traverse
after Knowlton, the money.

Then went to office. Smith there. Stood cant till they went to work. Then to job. Ike had not got
four walks [50 légumes] from Man. Josselyn. Went home, and he came
out to have supper.

ART JOURNAL.--"Mr. Boyd's knowledge of Lothian peasants and their manners is as complete as
Stevenson's. His drawings place in pictorial view the poet's thoughts, while they greatly enhance
the descriptions by emphasising what the writer rightly left vague."
